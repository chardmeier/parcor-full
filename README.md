This repository contains the ParCorFull corpus, documented in the following two papers:

Ekaterina Lapshinova-Koltunski, Pedro Augusto Ferreira, Elina Lartaud and Christian Hardmeier. [ParCorFull2.0: A Parallel Corpus Annotated with Full Coreference](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2022/pdf/2022.lrec-1.85.pdf). _Proc. 13th Conference on Linguistic Resources and Evaluation_ (LREC), Marseille FR, June **2022**, pp. 805--813.

Ekaterina Lapshinova-Koltunski, Christian Hardmeier and Pauline Krielke. [ParCorFull: a Parallel Corpus Annotated with Full Coreference](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/941.pdf). _Proc. 11th Conference on Linguistic Resources and Evaluation_ (LREC), Miyazaki JP, May **2018**, pp. 423--428.


The first official release of the corpus, containing data for English and German, is available here:

Ekaterina Lapshinova-Koltunski, Christian Hardmeier and Pauline Krielke. ParCorFull: A parallel corpus annotated with full coreference. 2018. [http://hdl.handle.net/11372/LRT-2614](http://hdl.handle.net/11372/LRT-2614).

We expect to make a formal release of ParCorFull 2.0 including French and Portuguese shortly. The data still needs some final cleanup, but the complete annotations are already included in this repository.

This project was supported by the Swedish Research Council under grant 2017-930.
