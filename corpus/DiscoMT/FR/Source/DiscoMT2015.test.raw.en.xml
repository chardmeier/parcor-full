<title>Andrew Solomon: Love, no matter what</title>
<description>What is it like to raise a child who's different from you in some fundamental way ? In this quietly moving talk, writer Andrew Solomon shares what he learned from talking to dozens of parents -- asking them: What's the line between unconditional love and unconditional acceptance?</description>

<seg id="1">"Even in purely non-religious terms, homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality -- a pitiable flight from life.</seg>
<seg id="3">As such, it deserves no compassion, it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom, and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."</seg>
<seg id="4">That's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.</seg>
<seg id="5">And last year, the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id="6">And my question is, how did we get from there to here?</seg>
<seg id="7">How did an illness become an identity?</seg>
<seg id="8">When I was perhaps six years old, I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.</seg>
<seg id="9">And at the end of buying our shoes, the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.</seg>
<seg id="10">My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.</seg>
<seg id="11">My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.</seg>
<seg id="12">But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.</seg>
<seg id="13">And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.</seg>
<seg id="14">The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay -- -- is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I was little, my mother used to say, "The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">And until you have children, you don't know what it's like."</seg>
<seg id="17">And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.</seg>
<seg id="18">And when I was an adolescent, I thought that I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.</seg>
<seg id="19">And when she said it, it made me anxious.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after I came out of the closet, when she continued to say it, it made me furious.</seg>
<seg id="21">I said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.</seg>
<seg id="22">And I want you to stop saying that."</seg>
<seg id="23">About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine to write a piece about deaf culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">And I was rather taken aback.</seg>
<seg id="25">I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those poor people, they couldn't hear.</seg>
<seg id="27">They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?</seg>
<seg id="28">And then I went out into the deaf world.</seg>
<seg id="29">I went to deaf clubs.</seg>
<seg id="30">I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.</seg>
<seg id="31">I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world, I become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said, "We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture," were saying something that was viable.</seg>
<seg id="33">It wasn't my culture, and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it, but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it, it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.</seg>
<seg id="34">It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.</seg>
<seg id="36">And when her daughter was born, she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me.</seg>
<seg id="37">She was facing the question of what to do with this child.</seg>
<seg id="38">Should she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity, get involved in the Little People of America, become aware of what was happening for dwarfs?</seg>
<seg id="40">And I suddenly thought, most deaf children are born to hearing parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Most gay people are born to straight parents.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world, and those gay people have to discover identity later on.</seg>
<seg id="45">And here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.</seg>
<seg id="46">And I thought, there it is again: A family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="47">And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are vertical identities, which are passed down generationally from parent to child.</seg>
<seg id="49">Those are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.</seg>
<seg id="50">Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.</seg>
<seg id="51">And while some of them can be difficult, there's no attempt to cure them.</seg>
<seg id="52">You can argue that it's harder in the United States -- our current presidency notwithstanding -- to be a person of color.</seg>
<seg id="53">And yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.</seg>
<seg id="55">And I call them horizontal identities, because the peer group is the horizontal experience.</seg>
<seg id="56">These are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.</seg>
<seg id="57">And those identities, those horizontal identities, people have almost always tried to cure.</seg>
<seg id="58">And I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them.</seg>
<seg id="59">And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place.</seg>
<seg id="60">There's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="61">And they don't always coincide.</seg>
<seg id="62">And a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don't love them, when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.</seg>
<seg id="63">Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child.</seg>
<seg id="64">But acceptance is something that takes time.</seg>
<seg id="65">It always takes time.</seg>
<seg id="66">One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.</seg>
<seg id="67">When he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism, a very disabling condition, and his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk, he would have no intellectual capacity, and he would probably not even recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="68">And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly.</seg>
<seg id="69">And his mother said she wasn't going to do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">And she took her son home.</seg>
<seg id="71">And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages, she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism, and she got Clinton enrolled with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And in the course of his childhood, he had 30 major surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="73">And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures, as a result of which he now can walk.</seg>
<seg id="74">And while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.</seg>
<seg id="75">And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.</seg>
<seg id="77">He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college, where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car that accommodated his unusual body.</seg>
<seg id="78">And his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college nearby -- and she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize, in the parking lot of a bar," she said.</seg>
<seg id="79">"And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.</seg>
<seg id="80">Two beers for them is four beers for him."</seg>
<seg id="81">She said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him, but I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="82">She said, "And then I thought, if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- " And I said to her, "What do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"</seg>
<seg id="83">And she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="84">Clinton just always had that light in him.</seg>
<seg id="85">And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."</seg>
<seg id="86">I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.</seg>
<seg id="87">This one is from 1968 -- The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America -- written by an important bioethicist.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said, "There is no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down syndrome child away, whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible, lethal sense.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is sad, yes -- dreadful. But it carries no guilt.</seg>
<seg id="90">True guilt arises only from an offense against a person, and a Down's is not a person."</seg>
<seg id="91">There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made in the treatment of gay people.</seg>
<seg id="92">The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.</seg>
<seg id="93">But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences, how we used to see people who were disabled, how inhuman we held people to be.</seg>
<seg id="94">And the change that's been accomplished there, which is almost equally radical, is one that we pay not very much attention to.</seg>
<seg id="95">One of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards, were taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers, their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="96">They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be, and so they decided they would build a little center -- two classrooms that they started with a few other parents -- to educate kids with D.S.</seg>
<seg id="97">And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center, where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.</seg>
<seg id="98">In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran, the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.</seg>
<seg id="99">The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors, those who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Robards had a lot to do with that.</seg>
<seg id="101">And I said, "Do you regret it?</seg>
<seg id="102">Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?</seg>
<seg id="103">Do you wish you'd never heard of it?"</seg>
<seg id="104">And interestingly his father said, "Well, for David, our son, I regret it, because for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world, and I'd like to give David an easier life.</seg>
<seg id="105">But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."</seg>
<seg id="106">And Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.</seg>
<seg id="107">For David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.</seg>
<seg id="108">But speaking for myself -- well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point -- speaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life, that speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."</seg>
<seg id="109">We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions And yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="110">Most deaf infants born in the United States now will receive Cochlear implants, which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver, and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.</seg>
<seg id="111">A compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111, is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.</seg>
<seg id="112">Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene, grow to full size.</seg>
<seg id="113">Testing in humans is around the corner.</seg>
<seg id="114">There are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before, making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies, or to terminate them.</seg>
<seg id="115">And so we have both social progress and medical progress.</seg>
<seg id="116">And I believe in both of them.</seg>
<seg id="117">I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful, and I think the same thing about the medical progress.</seg>
<seg id="118">But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.</seg>
<seg id="119">And when I see the way they're intersecting in conditions like the three I've just described, I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.</seg>
<seg id="120">We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.</seg>
<seg id="121">And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is, what do we validate in our children, and what do we cure in them?</seg>
<seg id="122">Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said, "When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,' what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different, non-autistic child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is what we hear when you pray for a cure -- that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."</seg>
<seg id="124">It's a very extreme point of view, but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="125">They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.</seg>
<seg id="126">One of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.</seg>
<seg id="127">It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me, and once they agreed, they were so full of their story that they couldn't stop telling it.</seg>
<seg id="128">And the first weekend I spent with them -- the first of many -- I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.</seg>
<seg id="129">And on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="130">We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.</seg>
<seg id="131">And I said, "If Dylan were here now, do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"</seg>
<seg id="132">And his father said, "I sure do.</seg>
<seg id="133">I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."</seg>
<seg id="134">And Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.</seg>
<seg id="135">And then she looked back up and said, "I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head."</seg>
<seg id="136">When I had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many dinners that we had together -- she said, "You know, when it first happened, I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.</seg>
<seg id="137">If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom, this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.</seg>
<seg id="138">But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don't want to imagine a life without them.</seg>
<seg id="139">I recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness, but the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.</seg>
<seg id="140">"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born, I've decided that it would not have been better for me."</seg>
<seg id="141">I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems, problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid, and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.</seg>
<seg id="142">And then I thought, all of us who have children love the children we have, with their flaws.</seg>
<seg id="143">If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children I have and give me other, better children -- more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter -- I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="144">And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove, so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting, which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think, where did you come from?</seg>
<seg id="145">It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed -- there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia, there are only so many families of children who are transgender, there are only so many families of prodigies -- who also face similar challenges in many ways -- there are only so many families in each of those categories -- but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing, then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="146">Ironically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference, that unite us.</seg>
<seg id="147">I decided to have children while I was working on this project.</seg>
<seg id="148">And many people were astonished and said, "But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="149">And I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="150">What I'm studying is how much love there can be, even when everything appears to be going wrong."</seg>
<seg id="151">I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen, a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.</seg>
<seg id="152">And when his ashes were interred, his mother said, "I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed, once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."</seg>
<seg id="153">And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so.</seg>
<seg id="154">So my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.</seg>
<seg id="155">I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.</seg>
<seg id="156">And so she and I have a daughter, and mother and daughter live in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="157">And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father, and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura, the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.</seg>
<seg id="158">So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states.</seg>
<seg id="159">And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.</seg>
<seg id="160">And there are people who think that families like mine shouldn't be allowed to exist.</seg>
<seg id="161">And I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.</seg>
<seg id="162">And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on, so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.</seg>
<seg id="163">The day after our son was born, the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.</seg>
<seg id="164">He wasn't extending his legs appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="165">She said that might mean that he had brain damage.</seg>
<seg id="166">In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically, which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.</seg>
<seg id="167">And he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.</seg>
<seg id="168">And as she told me all of these things, I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.</seg>
<seg id="169">And I thought, here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled, and I didn't want to join their number.</seg>
<seg id="170">Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.</seg>
<seg id="171">And like all parents since the dawn of time, I wanted to protect my child from illness.</seg>
<seg id="172">And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.</seg>
<seg id="173">And yet, I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for, that those would ultimately be his identity, and if they were his identity they would become my identity, that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="174">We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner, we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.</seg>
<seg id="175">We felt helpless.</seg>
<seg id="176">And at the end of five hours, they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.</seg>
<seg id="177">And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on, she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.</seg>
<seg id="178">But I thought how my mother was right.</seg>
<seg id="179">I thought, the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world, and until you have children, you don't know what it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="180">I think children had ensnared me the moment I connected fatherhood with loss.</seg>
<seg id="181">But I'm not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.</seg>
<seg id="182">I'd encountered so much strange love, and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.</seg>
<seg id="183">And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities.</seg>
<seg id="184">During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility, and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.</seg>
<seg id="185">And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools, enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery, I realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that I was ready to join them on their ship.</seg>
<seg id="186">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Sonia Shah: 3 reasons we still haven’t gotten rid of malaria</title>
<description>We’ve known how to cure malaria since the 1600s, so why does the disease still kill hundreds of thousands every year? It’s more than just a problem of medicine, says journalist Sonia Shah. A look into the history of malaria reveals three big-picture challenges to its eradication. Photos: Adam Nadel.</description>

<seg id="1">So over the long course of human history, the infectious disease that's killed more humans than any other is malaria.</seg>
<seg id="2">It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos, and it's probably our oldest scourge.</seg>
<seg id="3">We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.</seg>
<seg id="4">And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.</seg>
<seg id="5">We've got 300 million cases a year and over half a million deaths.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now this really makes no sense.</seg>
<seg id="7">We've known how to cure malaria since the 1600s.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree, and inside that bark was quinine, still an effective cure for malaria to this day.</seg>
<seg id="9">So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria, not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.</seg>
<seg id="12">So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve, and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.</seg>
<seg id="13">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a question that's personally intrigued me for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="15">I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants visiting my cousins in India every summer, and because I had no immunity to the local malarias, I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.</seg>
<seg id="16">And I really hated the mosquitos for that.</seg>
<seg id="17">But at the same time, I come from a Jain family, and Jainism is a religion that espouses a very extreme form of nonviolence.</seg>
<seg id="18">So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.</seg>
<seg id="19">We're not supposed to walk on grass, because you could, you know, inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.</seg>
<seg id="20">We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.</seg>
<seg id="21">So the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age, and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist trying to understand, why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?</seg>
<seg id="22">And I think there's three main reasons why.</seg>
<seg id="23">Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason, which is probably the biggest reason of all.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first reason is certainly scientific.</seg>
<seg id="25">This little parasite that causes malaria, it's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind.</seg>
<seg id="26">It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.</seg>
<seg id="27">These two environments are totally different, but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.</seg>
<seg id="28">So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite, and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.</seg>
<seg id="29">This little creature survives under siege like that,</seg>
<seg id="30">but not only does it survive, it has thrived.</seg>
<seg id="31">It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, the malaria parasite transforms itself like that seven times in its life cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other, they have totally different physiology.</seg>
<seg id="35">So say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.</seg>
<seg id="36">It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.</seg>
<seg id="37">It can hide in our bodies, undetected, unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks, for months, for years, in some cases even decades.</seg>
<seg id="38">So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle, but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.</seg>
<seg id="39">Only about 12 species of mosquitos carry most of the world's malaria, and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you might think, then, well, why don't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?</seg>
<seg id="41">We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.</seg>
<seg id="42">But say you live in the tropics and you walk outside your hut one day and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or say your cow does, or say your pig does, and then, say, it rains, and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.</seg>
<seg id="44">That's it. You've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.</seg>
<seg id="45">So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.</seg>
<seg id="46">We kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives.</seg>
<seg id="47">So there's a huge scientific challenge, but there's a huge economic challenge too.</seg>
<seg id="48">Malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on Earth, and there's a reason for that.</seg>
<seg id="49">If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're poor, you're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.</seg>
<seg id="51">These are places where mosquitos breed.</seg>
<seg id="52">You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.</seg>
<seg id="53">You're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible, so you're outside more.</seg>
<seg id="54">You're getting bitten by mosquitos more.</seg>
<seg id="55">So poverty causes malaria, but what we also know now is that malaria itself causes poverty.</seg>
<seg id="56">For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,</seg>
<seg id="57">so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also predisposes people to death from all other causes.</seg>
<seg id="59">So this has happened historically.</seg>
<seg id="60">We've been able to take malaria out of a society. Everything else stays the same,</seg>
<seg id="61">so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation, all the things that make people sick.</seg>
<seg id="62">But just if you take malaria out, deaths from everything else go down.</seg>
<seg id="63">And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society.</seg>
<seg id="64">What it means is, if you have malaria in your society, your economic growth is depressed by 1.3 percent every year, year after year after year, just this one disease alone.</seg>
<seg id="65">So this poses a huge economic challenge,</seg>
<seg id="66">because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it in a place where there's no roads, there's no infrastructure, there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold, there's no clinics, there's no clinicians to deliver these things where they're needed?</seg>
<seg id="67">So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.</seg>
<seg id="68">But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge, there's also a cultural challenge, and this is probably the part about malaria that people don't like to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="69">And it's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least.</seg>
<seg id="70">This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.</seg>
<seg id="71">They ask people in malarious parts of the world, "What do you think about malaria?" And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it." They say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life." And that was certainly my personal experience.</seg>
<seg id="72">When I told my relatives in India that I was writing a book about malaria, they kind of looked at me like I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.</seg>
<seg id="73">Like, why would you write about something so boring, so ordinary? You know?</seg>
<seg id="74">And it's simple risk perception, really.</seg>
<seg id="75">A child in Malawi, for example, she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two, but if she survives, she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life, but she's much less likely to die of it.</seg>
<seg id="76">And so in her lived experience, malaria is something that comes and goes.</seg>
<seg id="77">And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.</seg>
<seg id="78">Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's just, there's so much malaria that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death add up to this big, huge number.</seg>
<seg id="80">So I think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu. Right?</seg>
<seg id="81">Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies and on our own lives, but we don't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and flu during cold and flu season.</seg>
<seg id="82">And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria, because if people think it's normal to have malaria, then how do you get them to run to the doctor to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription, to get it filled, to take the drugs, to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?</seg>
<seg id="83">This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.</seg>
<seg id="84">So take all that together.</seg>
<seg id="85">We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated, it's economically challenging to deal with, and it's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least.</seg>
<seg id="86">And that adds up to the biggest problem of all, which, of course, is the political problem.</seg>
<seg id="87">How do you get a political leader to do anything about a problem like this?</seg>
<seg id="88">And the answer is, historically, you don't.</seg>
<seg id="89">Most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="90">So the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies, from people who aren't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics.</seg>
<seg id="91">But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="92">The first concerted attack against malaria started in the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="93">It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.</seg>
<seg id="94">And this effort well understood the economic challenge.</seg>
<seg id="95">They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools, and they focused on DDT.</seg>
<seg id="96">They understood the cultural challenge.</seg>
<seg id="97">In fact, their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everything should be done to them and for them.</seg>
<seg id="99">But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.</seg>
<seg id="100">They had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research.</seg>
<seg id="101">And so when those tools started to fail, and public opinion started to turn against those tools, they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.</seg>
<seg id="102">The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back, but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign "one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health." The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="103">It's similarly directed and financed primarily from outside of malarious societies.</seg>
<seg id="104">Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.</seg>
<seg id="105">They are doing tons of malaria research.</seg>
<seg id="106">And they understand the economic challenge too.</seg>
<seg id="107">They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.</seg>
<seg id="108">But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.</seg>
<seg id="109">The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.</seg>
<seg id="110">It's treated with insecticides.</seg>
<seg id="111">This thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions.</seg>
<seg id="112">And when you think about the bed net, it's sort of a surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="113">You know, it doesn't really have any value to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.</seg>
<seg id="114">And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.</seg>
<seg id="115">They have to sleep under them every night.</seg>
<seg id="116">That's the only way they are effective.</seg>
<seg id="117">And they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze, even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves, even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up, even if, you know, they might live in a round hut in which it's difficult to string up a square net.</seg>
<seg id="118">Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.</seg>
<seg id="119">I mean, these are minor inconveniences.</seg>
<seg id="120">But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.</seg>
<seg id="121">So for them, the calculus must be quite different.</seg>
<seg id="122">Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said, "You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.</seg>
<seg id="123">We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool, we're going to give it to you for free.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's called a face mask, and all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work." Would we do that?</seg>
<seg id="125">And I wonder if that's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them?</seg>
<seg id="126">Indeed, we know from studies that only 20 percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used.</seg>
<seg id="127">And even that's probably an overestimate, because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients, "Oh, did you use that net I gave you?" Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you, "Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?" So it's probably an overestimate.</seg>
<seg id="128">But that's not an insurmountable problem.</seg>
<seg id="129">We can do more education, we can try to convince these people to use the nets.</seg>
<seg id="130">And that's what happening now.</seg>
<seg id="131">We're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and school meetings, all these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you.</seg>
<seg id="132">And that might work.</seg>
<seg id="133">But it takes time. It takes money.</seg>
<seg id="134">It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="135">It takes all the things that that cheap, easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.</seg>
<seg id="136">So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies, but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it from outside of those societies.</seg>
<seg id="137">We end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world.</seg>
<seg id="138">That's exactly what we did in the 1950s, and that effort backfired.</seg>
<seg id="139">I would argue today, when we are distributing tools that we've designed and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives, we run the risk of making the same mistake again.</seg>
<seg id="140">That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable, because I think it is, but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?</seg>
<seg id="141">Take the example of England and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="142">We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years, and we got rid of it completely, not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.</seg>
<seg id="143">We attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.</seg>
<seg id="144">We attacked the malarious way of life, and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.</seg>
<seg id="145">Now attacking the malarious way of life, this is something -- these are things people care about today.</seg>
<seg id="146">And attacking the malarious way of life, it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy, but I think it's the only lasting way forward.</seg>
<seg id="147">Thank you so much.</seg>

<title>Benjamin Barber: Why mayors should rule the world</title>
<description>It often seems like federal-level politicians care more about creating gridlock than solving the world's problems. So who's actually getting bold things done? City mayors. So, political theorist Benjamin Barber suggests: Let's give them more control over global policy. Barber shows how these "urban homeboys" are solving pressing problems on their own turf -- and maybe in the world.</description>

<seg id="1">Democracy is in trouble, no question about that, and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded.</seg>
<seg id="2">It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics, a cross-border problem; with HIV, a transnational problem; with markets and immigration, something that goes beyond national borders; with terrorism, with war, all now cross-border problems.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, we live in a 21st-century world of interdependence, and brutal interdependent problems, and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy, we are faced with political institutions designed 400 years ago, autonomous, sovereign nation-states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another, each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Twenty-first-century, transnational world of problems and challenges, 17th-century world of political institutions.</seg>
<seg id="5">In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="6">And like many others, I've been thinking about what can one do about this, this asymmetry between 21st-century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation-states.</seg>
<seg id="7">And my suggestion is that we change the subject, that we stop talking about nations, about bordered states, and we start talking about cities.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities, we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are talking about the cradle of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy, and at the same time protest those who would take our freedom, take place.</seg>
<seg id="11">Think of some great names: the Place de la Bastille, Zuccotti Park, Tahrir Square, Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul, or, yes, Tiananmen Square in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens, as participants, as people with the right to write our own narratives.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you think about it, Constantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="15">Alexandria, much older than Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rome, far older than Italy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cities endure the ages.</seg>
<seg id="18">They are the places where we are born, grow up, are educated, work, marry, pray, play, get old, and in time, die.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are home.</seg>
<seg id="20">Very different than nation-states, which are abstractions.</seg>
<seg id="21">We pay taxes, we vote occasionally, we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, today, more than half of the world's population live in cities.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the developed world, it's about 78 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">More than three out of four people live in urban institutions, urban places, in cities today.</seg>
<seg id="26">So cities are where the action is.</seg>
<seg id="27">Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world, man is a political animal.</seg>
<seg id="28">I say we are an urban animal.</seg>
<seg id="29">We are an urban species, at home in our cities.</seg>
<seg id="30">So to come back to the dilemma,</seg>
<seg id="31">if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned political nation-states unable to govern the world, respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change, then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world, for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance.</seg>
<seg id="32">When I say if mayors ruled the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually, they already do.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are scores of international, inter-city, cross-border institutions, networks of cities in which cities are already, quite quietly, below the horizon, working together to deal with climate change, to deal with security, to deal with immigration, to deal with all of those tough, interdependent problems that we face.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have strange names: UCLG, United Cities and Local Governments; ICLEI, the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the list goes on: Citynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization out of Barcelona that is using the web to share best practices among countries.</seg>
<seg id="36">And then all the things we know a little better, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Mexican Conference of Mayors, the European Conference of Mayors.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mayors are where this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="38">And so the question is, how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role?</seg>
<seg id="39">Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.</seg>
<seg id="40">To be a prime minister or a president, you have to have an ideology, you have to have a meta-narrative, you have to have a theory of how things work, you have to belong to a party.</seg>
<seg id="41">Independents, on the whole, don't get elected to office.</seg>
<seg id="42">But mayors are just the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.</seg>
<seg id="44">Their job is to get things done, and if they don't, they're out of a job.</seg>
<seg id="45">Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said, we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington, the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.</seg>
<seg id="46">Why? Because potholes have to get filled, because the trains have to run, because kids have to be able to get to school.</seg>
<seg id="47">And that's what we have to do, and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep, American sense, reaching outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals, are anything but pragmatic, but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.</seg>
<seg id="49">They have to get things done, they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together.</seg>
<seg id="50">We saw this a couple of decades ago when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem in the '80s and the '90s, was besieged one day in his office by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds, Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.</seg>
<seg id="51">They were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites.</seg>
<seg id="52">And the squabble went on and on, and Kollek listened and listened, and he finally said, "Gentlemen, spare me your sermons, and I will fix your sewers." That's what mayors do.</seg>
<seg id="53">They fix sewers, they get the trains running.</seg>
<seg id="54">There isn't a left or a right way of doing.</seg>
<seg id="55">Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.</seg>
<seg id="56">Strange term, but in some ways, he is.</seg>
<seg id="57">He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.</seg>
<seg id="58">He rides to work on a bike, but at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.</seg>
<seg id="59">Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat, then he was a Republican, and finally he was an Independent, and said the party label just gets in the way.</seg>
<seg id="60">Luzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow, though he helped found a party, United Party with Putin, in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev, not under Gorbachev, but under Putin, who wanted a more faithful party follower.</seg>
<seg id="61">So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.</seg>
<seg id="62">They get things done.</seg>
<seg id="63">But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys, or to include the women mayors, homies.</seg>
<seg id="64">They're from the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="65">They're part of the neighborhood. They're known.</seg>
<seg id="66">Ed Koch used to wander around New York City saying, "How am I doing?" Imagine David Cameron wandering around the United Kingdom asking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.</seg>
<seg id="67">Or Putin. Or any national leader.</seg>
<seg id="68">He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers and they knew him.</seg>
<seg id="69">Mayors are usually from the places they govern.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.</seg>
<seg id="71">You can run for the Senate out of a different state, but it's hard to do that as a mayor.</seg>
<seg id="72">And as a result, mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level, and this is the third feature about mayors,</seg>
<seg id="73">In the United States, we know the pathetic figures: 18 percent of Americans approve of Congress and what they do.</seg>
<seg id="74">And even with a relatively popular president like Obama, the figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45, sometimes 50 percent at best.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.</seg>
<seg id="76">But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor, do you trust your mayor?" the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent, because they're from the neighborhood, because the people they work with are their neighbors, because, like Mayor Booker in Newark, a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building -- that happened to Mayor Booker -- or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it.</seg>
<seg id="77">No head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it, nor be in a position to do it.</seg>
<seg id="78">That's the difference, and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves, because cities are profoundly multicultural, open, participatory, democratic, able to work with one another.</seg>
<seg id="79">When states face each other, China and the U.S., they face each other like this.</seg>
<seg id="80">When cities interact, they interact like this.</seg>
<seg id="81">China and the U.S., despite the recent meta-meeting in California, are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry for number one.</seg>
<seg id="82">We heard more about who will be number one.</seg>
<seg id="83">Cities don't worry about number one.</seg>
<seg id="84">They have to work together, and they do work together.</seg>
<seg id="85">They work together in climate change, for example.</seg>
<seg id="86">Organizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned, have been working together many, many years before Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="87">In Copenhagen, four or five years ago, 184 nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn't permit them to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change, but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited 200 mayors to attend.</seg>
<seg id="88">They came, they stayed, and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together, city-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.</seg>
<seg id="89">Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities, which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem, or most of it, whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another.</seg>
<seg id="90">And they are doing it.</seg>
<seg id="91">Los Angeles cleaned up its port, which was 40 percent of carbon emissions, and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.</seg>
<seg id="92">New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings, make them better insulated in the winter, to not leak energy in the summer, not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.</seg>
<seg id="93">Bogota, where Mayor Mockus, when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system that saved energy, that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways, express buses with corridors.</seg>
<seg id="94">It helped unemployment, because people could get across town, and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there.</seg>
<seg id="95">Singapore, as it developed its high-rises and its remarkable public housing, also developed an island of parks, and if you go there, you'll see how much of it is green land and park land.</seg>
<seg id="96">Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.</seg>
<seg id="97">They are doing it together.</seg>
<seg id="98">They are sharing what they do, and they are making a difference by shared best practices.</seg>
<seg id="99">Bike shares, many of you have heard of it, started 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="100">Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="101">Pedestrian zones, congestion fees, emission limits in cities like California cities have, there's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.</seg>
<seg id="102">So what's the bottom line here?</seg>
<seg id="103">The bottom line is, we still live politically in a world of borders, a world of boundaries, a world of walls, a world where states refuse to act together.</seg>
<seg id="104">Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders, a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders, maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières, of economics and technology without borders, of education without borders, of terrorism and war without borders.</seg>
<seg id="105">That is the real world, and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization, we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems, but we will risk losing democracy itself, locked up in the old nation-state box, unable to address global problems democratically.</seg>
<seg id="106">So where does that leave us?</seg>
<seg id="107">I'll tell you. The road to global democracy doesn't run through states.</seg>
<seg id="108">It runs through cities.</seg>
<seg id="109">Democracy was born in the ancient polis.</seg>
<seg id="110">I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.</seg>
<seg id="111">In that journey from polis to cosmopolis, we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level.</seg>
<seg id="112">We can create not a League of Nations, which failed, but a League of Cities, not a United or a dis-United Nations, but United Cities of the World.</seg>
<seg id="113">We can create a global parliament of mayors.</seg>
<seg id="114">That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world, but it's also on the table in City Halls in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam, in Hamburg, and in New York.</seg>
<seg id="115">Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors, and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us, of you and of me.</seg>
<seg id="116">If ever there were citizens without borders, I think it's the citizens of TED who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.</seg>
<seg id="117">I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy, to take back our democracy.</seg>
<seg id="118">And the only question is, are you?</seg>
<seg id="119">Thank you so much, my fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Andrew Solomon: Depression, the secret we share</title>
<description>"The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment." In a talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across the world to interview others with depression -- only to discover that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted to tell their own stories. </description>

<seg id="1">"I felt a funeral in my brain, and mourners to and fro kept treading, treading till I felt that sense was breaking through.</seg>
<seg id="2">And when they all were seated, a service, like a drum, kept beating, beating, till I felt my mind was going numb.</seg>
<seg id="3">And then I heard them lift a box and creak across my soul with those same boots of lead again, then space began to toll, as if the heavens were a bell and being were an ear, and I, and silence, some strange race wrecked, solitary, here.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just then, a plank in reason broke, and I fell down and down and hit a world at every plunge, and finished knowing then."</seg>
<seg id="5">We know depression through metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language, Goya in an image.</seg>
<seg id="7">Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for me, I had always thought myself tough, one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 1991, I had a series of losses.</seg>
<seg id="10">My mother died, a relationship I'd been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact.</seg>
<seg id="11">But in 1994, three years later, I found myself losing interest in almost everything.</seg>
<seg id="12">I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn't know why.</seg>
<seg id="13">The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Everything there was to do seemed like too much work.</seg>
<seg id="15">I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine, and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends, I would think, "What a lot of people that is to have to call back."</seg>
<seg id="16">Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.</seg>
<seg id="17">And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="18">You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it.</seg>
<seg id="19">You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal, and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was a kind of nullity.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the anxiety set in.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, "As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it."</seg>
<seg id="24">But if you said to me, "You have to have acute anxiety for the next month," I would rather slit my wrist than go through it.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you, but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does, it lasted for six months.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of.</seg>
<seg id="27">And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people.</seg>
<seg id="28">And finally one day, I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke, because I lay in bed completely frozen, looking at the telephone, thinking, "Something is wrong and I should call for help," and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial.</seg>
<seg id="29">And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang, and somehow I managed to pick it up, and it was my father, and I said, "I'm in serious trouble.</seg>
<seg id="30">We need to do something."</seg>
<seg id="31">The next day I started with the medications and the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="32">And I also started reckoning with this terrible question: If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp, then who am I?</seg>
<seg id="33">And if I have to take medication, is that medication making me more fully myself, or is it making me someone else?</seg>
<seg id="34">And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else?</seg>
<seg id="35">I had two advantages as I went in to the fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the other was that I had access to good treatment.</seg>
<seg id="38">But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever.</seg>
<seg id="39">And I thought, "But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem?</seg>
<seg id="40">And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?"</seg>
<seg id="41">And I couldn't figure out which it was.</seg>
<seg id="42">And then I understood that actually, we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully.</seg>
<seg id="43">The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality.</seg>
<seg id="44">I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling.</seg>
<seg id="45">They're not very effective.</seg>
<seg id="46">They're extremely costly.</seg>
<seg id="47">They come with innumerable side effects.</seg>
<seg id="48">They're a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="49">But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago, when there would have been almost nothing to be done.</seg>
<seg id="50">I hope that 50 years hence, people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science.</seg>
<seg id="51">Depression is the flaw in love.</seg>
<seg id="52">If you were married to someone and thought, "Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one," it wouldn't be love as we know it.</seg>
<seg id="53">There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss, and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness.</seg>
<seg id="55">Grief is explicitly reactive.</seg>
<seg id="56">If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy, and then, six months later, you are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better, it's probably grief, and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure.</seg>
<seg id="57">If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="58">The trajectory tells us a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="59">People think of depression as being just sadness.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause.</seg>
<seg id="61">As I set out to understand depression, and to interview people who had experienced it, I found that there were people who seemed on the surface to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it.</seg>
<seg id="62">And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes.</seg>
<seg id="63">And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people.</seg>
<seg id="64">What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive?</seg>
<seg id="65">And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression.</seg>
<seg id="66">One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead, and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness, that this is a serious business.</seg>
<seg id="67">It's the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day.</seg>
<seg id="68">One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years, and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college, and then plummeted into a horrific depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">She had bipolar illness, or manic depression, as it was then known.</seg>
<seg id="70">And then she did very well for many years on lithium, and then eventually, she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it, and she had another psychosis, and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment, more or less catatonic, essentially without moving, day after day after day.</seg>
<seg id="71">And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later -- she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins — when I interviewed her, she said, "I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone' over and over to occupy my mind.</seg>
<seg id="72">I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying, which were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody.</seg>
<seg id="73">You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself."</seg>
<seg id="74">You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="75">You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth.</seg>
<seg id="77">But the truth lies.</seg>
<seg id="78">I became obsessed with that sentence: "But the truth lies."</seg>
<seg id="79">And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people, that they have many delusional perceptions.</seg>
<seg id="80">People will say, "No one loves me."</seg>
<seg id="81">And you say, "I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you."</seg>
<seg id="82">You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people.</seg>
<seg id="83">But people who are depressed will also say, "No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end."</seg>
<seg id="84">Or they'll say, "There can be no true communion between two human beings.</seg>
<seg id="85">Each of us is trapped in his own body."</seg>
<seg id="86">To which you have to say, "That's true, but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="87">A lot of the time, what they are expressing is not illness, but insight, and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much.</seg>
<seg id="88">There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour, and at the end of the hour, they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed.</seg>
<seg id="89">The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent, and the non-depressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters — — as they had actually killed.</seg>
<seg id="90">A lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression, that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet, to have people know.</seg>
<seg id="91">They said, "Do people talk to you differently?"</seg>
<seg id="92">And I said, "Yes, people talk to me differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience, or their sister's experience, or their friend's experience.</seg>
<seg id="94">Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has.</seg>
<seg id="95">I went a few years ago to a conference, and on Friday of the three-day conference, one of the participants took me aside, and she said, "I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it, but I've been taking this medication, and I just wanted to ask you what you think?"</seg>
<seg id="96">And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could.</seg>
<seg id="97">And then she said, "You know, my husband would never understand this.</seg>
<seg id="98">He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense, so I just, you know, it's just between us."</seg>
<seg id="99">And I said, "Yes, that's fine."</seg>
<seg id="100">On Sunday of the same conference, her husband took me aside, and he said, "My wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this, but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication, and I wondered what you think?"</seg>
<seg id="101">They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom.</seg>
<seg id="102">And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems.</seg>
<seg id="103">But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="104">Depression is so exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="105">It takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse.</seg>
<seg id="106">And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'd started off as a medical conservative.</seg>
<seg id="108">I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked, it was clear what they were -- there was medication, there were certain psychotherapies, there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment, and that everything else was nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="109">But then I discovered something.</seg>
<seg id="110">If you have brain cancer, and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer, and you'll still probably die from it.</seg>
<seg id="111">But if you say that you have depression, and standing on your head for 20 minutes every day makes you feel better, then it's worked, because depression is an illness of how you feel, and if you feel better, then you are effectively not depressed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="112">So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="113">And I get letters, I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them.</seg>
<seg id="114">Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation.</seg>
<seg id="115">My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy, she had tried medication, she had tried pretty much everything, and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world, and that was making little things from yarn.</seg>
<seg id="116">She sent me some of them.</seg>
<seg id="117">And I'm not wearing them right now.</seg>
<seg id="118">I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.</seg>
<seg id="119">And yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments, I also gained perspective on other treatments.</seg>
<seg id="120">I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram's blood and that I'm not going to detail right now, but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda working on a different project, and I happened to describe my experience to someone, and he said, "Well, you know, that's West Africa, and we're in East Africa, and our rituals are in some ways very different, but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you're describing."</seg>
<seg id="121">And I said, "Oh." And he said, "Yes," he said, "but we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers, especially the ones who came right after the genocide."</seg>
<seg id="122">And I said, "What kind of trouble did you have?"</seg>
<seg id="123">And he said, "Well, they would do this bizarre thing.</seg>
<seg id="124">They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better.</seg>
<seg id="125">They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going.</seg>
<seg id="126">They didn't involve the whole community.</seg>
<seg id="127">They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit.</seg>
<seg id="128">Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="129">He said, "We had to ask them to leave the country."</seg>
<seg id="130">Now at the other end of alternative treatments, let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.</seg>
<seg id="131">Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.</seg>
<seg id="132">He was constantly depressed.</seg>
<seg id="133">He was, when I met him, at a point at which every month he would have electroshock treatment.</seg>
<seg id="134">Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week.</seg>
<seg id="135">Then he would feel okay for a week.</seg>
<seg id="136">Then he would have a week of going downhill.</seg>
<seg id="137">And then he would have another electroshock treatment.</seg>
<seg id="138">And he said to me when I met him, "It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way.</seg>
<seg id="139">I can't go on this way, and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better.</seg>
<seg id="140">But," he said to me, "I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery, and I think I'm going to give that a try."</seg>
<seg id="141">And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him somewhere enough optimism to reach out for one more.</seg>
<seg id="142">And he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful.</seg>
<seg id="143">He's now a friend of mine.</seg>
<seg id="144">He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children.</seg>
<seg id="145">He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery, and he said, "My father sent me two presents this year, First, a motorized C.D. rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need, but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love.</seg>
<seg id="146">And the other present was a photo of my grandmother, who committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="147">As I unwrapped it, I began to cry, and my mother came over and said, 'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?' And I said, 'She had the same disease I have.' I'm crying now as I write to you.</seg>
<seg id="148">It's not that I'm so sad, but I get overwhelmed, I think, because I could have killed myself, but my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors, and I had the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="149">I'm alive and grateful.</seg>
<seg id="150">We live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it."</seg>
<seg id="151">I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing, and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts, and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent.</seg>
<seg id="152">And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression.</seg>
<seg id="153">And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression.</seg>
<seg id="154">Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability, which is presumably evenly distributed in the population, and triggering circumstances, which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished.</seg>
<seg id="155">And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time, you think, "Why do I feel like this?</seg>
<seg id="156">I must have depression."</seg>
<seg id="157">And you set out to find treatment for it.</seg>
<seg id="158">But if you have a perfectly awful life, and you feel miserable all the time, the way you feel is commensurate with your life, and it doesn't occur to you to think, "Maybe this is treatable."</seg>
<seg id="159">And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed, and it's a tragedy of a grand order.</seg>
<seg id="160">And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C., where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression, and then provided six months of the experimental protocol.</seg>
<seg id="161">One of them, Lolly, came in, and this is what she said the day she came in.</seg>
<seg id="162">She said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children. She said, "I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house.</seg>
<seg id="163">I have nothing to say to my children.</seg>
<seg id="164">In the morning, I can't wait for them to leave, and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head, and three o'clock when they come home, it just comes so fast."</seg>
<seg id="165">She said, "I've been taking a lot of Tylenol, anything I can take so that I can sleep more.</seg>
<seg id="166">My husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly.</seg>
<seg id="167">I wish I could stop the pain."</seg>
<seg id="168">Well, she was brought into this experimental protocol, and when I interviewed her six months later, she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband, and she said to me, "My kids are so much happier now."</seg>
<seg id="169">She said, "There's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls, but at night, they're just all up on my bed, and we're doing homework all together and everything.</seg>
<seg id="170">One of them wants to be a preacher, one of them wants to be a firefighter, and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="171">They don't cry like they used to, and they don't fight like they did.</seg>
<seg id="172">That's all I need now is my kids.</seg>
<seg id="173">Things keep on changing, the way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act.</seg>
<seg id="174">I can go outside not being afraid anymore, and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back, and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that, I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head, if I were still alive at all.</seg>
<seg id="175">I asked the Lord to send me an angel, and he heard my prayers."</seg>
<seg id="176">I was really moved by these experiences, and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on, but also in an article, and so I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent.</seg>
<seg id="177">And I turned in my story, and my editor called me and said, "We really can't publish this."</seg>
<seg id="178">And I said, "Why not?"</seg>
<seg id="179">And she said, "It just is too far-fetched.</seg>
<seg id="180">These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley?</seg>
<seg id="181">It's just too implausible."</seg>
<seg id="182">She said, I've never even heard of anything like it."</seg>
<seg id="183">And I said, "The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news."</seg>
<seg id="184">"And you are a news magazine."</seg>
<seg id="185">So after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it.</seg>
<seg id="186">But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment, the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities, that would be an exploitative thing to do, because we would be changing them.</seg>
<seg id="187">There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us that treatment of depression, the medications and so on, are an artifice, and that it's not natural.</seg>
<seg id="188">And I think that's very misguided.</seg>
<seg id="189">It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out, but there is nobody militating against toothpaste, at least not in my circles.</seg>
<seg id="190">And people then say, "Well, but isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience?</seg> 
<seg id="191">Didn't we evolve to have depression?</seg>
<seg id="192">Isn't it part of your personality?"</seg>
<seg id="193">To which I would say, mood is adaptive.</seg>
<seg id="194">Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable.</seg>
<seg id="195">And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken.</seg>
<seg id="196">It's maladaptive.</seg>
<seg id="197">People will come to me and say, "I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year, I think I can just get through this."</seg>
<seg id="198">And I always say to them, "You may get through it, but you'll never be 37 again.</seg>
<seg id="199">Life is short, and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up.</seg>
<seg id="200">Think it through."</seg>
<seg id="201">It's a strange poverty of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use this same word, depression, to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="202">People say to me, "Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?"</seg>
<seg id="203">And I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness.</seg>
<seg id="204">There is a certain amount of continuity, but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting, and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust.</seg>
<seg id="205">And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that's the one we're setting out to address.</seg>
<seg id="206">So now people say, "You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"</seg>
<seg id="207">And I don't.</seg>
<seg id="208">But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower.</seg>
<seg id="209">I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity.</seg>
<seg id="210">I feel sad about professional disappointments, about damaged relationships, about global warming.</seg>
<seg id="211">Those are the things that I feel sad about now.</seg>
<seg id="212">And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion?</seg>
<seg id="213">How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through?</seg>
<seg id="214">What is the mechanism of resilience?</seg>
<seg id="215">And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience, the ones who say, "I was depressed a long time ago and I never want to think about it again and I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life," ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have.</seg>
<seg id="216">Shutting out the depression strengthens it.</seg>
<seg id="217">While you hide from it, it grows.</seg>
<seg id="218">And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition.</seg>
<seg id="219">Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.</seg>
<seg id="220">So Frank Russakoff said to me, "If I had it again to do over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way, but in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced.</seg>
<seg id="221">I'm glad to have been in the hospital 40 times.</seg>
<seg id="222">It taught me so much about love, and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me, and will be always."</seg>
<seg id="223">And Maggie Robbins said, "I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic, and I would just talk and talk and talk, and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought, 'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.' And then I realized, I realized that they weren't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk.</seg>
<seg id="224">It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying, but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were.</seg>
<seg id="225">Our needs are our greatest assets.</seg>
<seg id="226">It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need."</seg>
<seg id="227">Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse, but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate.</seg>
<seg id="228">The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="229">It's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again, "This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="230">I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts, and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way.</seg>
<seg id="231">The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and these days, my life is vital, even on the days when I'm sad.</seg>
<seg id="232">I felt that funeral in my brain, and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world, and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.</seg>
<seg id="233">I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I've found a way to love my depression.</seg>
<seg id="234">I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy.</seg>
<seg id="235">I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely, and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living.</seg>
<seg id="236">And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.</seg>
<seg id="237">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Siddharthan Chandran: Can the damaged brain repair itself?</title>
<description>After a traumatic brain injury, it sometimes happens that the brain can repair itself, building new brain cells to replace damaged ones. But the repair doesn't happen quickly enough to allow recovery from degenerative conditions like motor neuron disease (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). Siddharthan Chandran walks through some new techniques using special stem cells that could allow the damaged brain to rebuild faster.</description>

<seg id="1">I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain, and I'm particularly excited by this field, because as a neurologist myself, I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2">So here's the problem.</seg>
<seg id="3">You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain, and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain, ringed red, there's obvious damage -- atrophy, scarring.</seg>
<seg id="4">And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease: multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, even Huntington's disease, and they would all tell a similar story.</seg>
<seg id="5">And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time.</seg>
<seg id="6">And the numbers here are really rather staggering.</seg>
<seg id="7">At any one time, there are 35 million people today living with one of these brain diseases, and the annual cost globally is 700 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="8">I mean, just think about that.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's greater than one percent of the global GDP.</seg>
<seg id="10">And it gets worse, because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age-related diseases, and we're living longer.</seg>
<seg id="11">So the question we really need to ask ourselves is, why, given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual, never mind the scale of the societal problem, why are there no effective treatments?</seg>
<seg id="12">Now in order to consider this, I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works.</seg>
<seg id="13">So in other words, I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school.</seg>
<seg id="14">But believe me, this isn't going to take very long.</seg>
<seg id="15">Okay? So the brain is terribly simple: it's made up of four cells, and two of them are shown here.</seg>
<seg id="16">There's the nerve cell, and then there's the myelinating cell, or the insulating cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's called oligodendrocyte.</seg>
<seg id="18">And when these four cells work together in health and harmony, they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity, and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think, to emote, to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.</seg>
<seg id="19">But equally, each of these individual four cells alone or together, can go rogue or die, and when that happens, you get damage.</seg>
<seg id="20">You get damaged wiring.</seg>
<seg id="21">You get disrupted connections.</seg>
<seg id="22">And that's evident here with the slower conduction.</seg>
<seg id="23">But ultimately, this damage will manifest as disease, clearly.</seg>
<seg id="24">And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve, for example, you'll get motor neuron disease.</seg>
<seg id="25">So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">So this is a patient of mine called John.</seg>
<seg id="27">John I saw just last week in the clinic.</seg>
<seg id="28">And I've asked John to tell us something about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease.</seg>
<seg id="29">I was diagnosed in October in 2011, and the main problem was a breathing problem, difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you caught all of that, but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.</seg>
<seg id="31">So John's now 18 months further down in that journey, and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament.</seg>
<seg id="32">What I've got now is the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands, my arms and my legs.</seg>
<seg id="33">So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.</seg>
<seg id="34">John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time.</seg>
<seg id="35">So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease, but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease, because in just 18 months, a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair- and respirator-dependent. And let's face it, John could be anybody's father, brother or friend.</seg>
<seg id="36">So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But what happens when that myelin cell dies?</seg>
<seg id="38">You get multiple sclerosis.</seg>
<seg id="39">So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain, and it's a map of the connections of the brain, and superimposed upon which are areas of damage.</seg>
<seg id="40">We call them lesions of demyelination.</seg>
<seg id="41">But they're damage, and they're white.</seg>
<seg id="42">So I know what you're thinking here.</seg>
<seg id="43">You're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope, and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale." I've told you these diseases are terrible.</seg>
<seg id="44">They're devastating, numbers are rising, the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all, we have no treatment. Where's the hope?</seg>
<seg id="45">Well, you know what? I think there is hope.</seg>
<seg id="46">And there's hope in this next section, of this brain section of somebody else with M.S., because what it illustrates is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.</seg>
<seg id="47">It just doesn't do it well enough.</seg>
<seg id="48">And so again, there are two things I want to show you.</seg>
<seg id="49">First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.</seg>
<seg id="50">And again, it's another one of these white masses.</seg>
<seg id="51">But crucially, the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But that area that is pale blue was once white.</seg>
<seg id="53">So it was damaged. It's now repaired.</seg>
<seg id="54">Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.</seg>
<seg id="56">This is spontaneous repair.</seg>
<seg id="57">It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain, even, which can enable new myelin, new insulation, to be laid down over the damaged nerves.</seg>
<seg id="58">And this observation is important for two reasons.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school, or at least I did, admittedly last century, which is that the brain doesn't repair itself, unlike, say, the bone or the liver.</seg>
<seg id="60">But actually it does, but it just doesn't do it well enough.</seg>
<seg id="61">And the second thing it does, and it gives us a very clear direction of travel for new therapies -- I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here.</seg>
<seg id="62">You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous, spontaneous repair that occurs anyway.</seg>
<seg id="63">So the question is, why, if we've known that for some time, as we have, why do we not have those treatments?</seg>
<seg id="64">And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development.</seg>
<seg id="65">Now, drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet, and the odds of this bet are roughly this: they're 10,000 to one against, because you need to screen about 10,000 compounds to find that one potential winner.</seg>
<seg id="66">And then you need to spend 15 years and spend over a billion dollars, and even then, you may not have a winner.</seg>
<seg id="67">So the question for us is, can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds?</seg>
<seg id="68">And in order to do that, you have to think, where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?</seg>
<seg id="69">And one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery.</seg>
<seg id="70">All that screening occurs in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="71">But we know that the proper study of mankind is man, to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is, can we study these diseases using human material?</seg>
<seg id="72">And of course, absolutely we can.</seg>
<seg id="73">We can use stem cells, and specifically we can use human stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="74">And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things: they can self-renew or make more of themselves, but they can also become specialized to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells, maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell.</seg>
<seg id="75">And the challenge has long been, can we harness the power, the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology?</seg>
<seg id="76">And I think we can now, and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last 10, 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="77">One of them was here in Edinburgh, and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.</seg>
<seg id="78">So Dolly was made in Edinburgh, and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell.</seg>
<seg id="79">But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka.</seg>
<seg id="80">And what Yamaka did, in a fantastic form of scientific cookery, was he showed that four ingredients, just four ingredients, could effectively convert any cell, adult cell, into a master stem cell.</seg>
<seg id="81">And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate, because what it means that from anybody in this room, but particularly patients, you could now generate a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.</seg>
<seg id="82">Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell, so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease, both to study but potentially to treat.</seg>
<seg id="83">Now, the idea of that at medical school -- this is a recurring theme, isn't it, me and medical school? — would have been ridiculous, but it's an absolute reality today.</seg>
<seg id="84">And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration, repair and hope.</seg>
<seg id="85">And whilst we're on the theme of hope, for those of you who might have failed at school, there's hope for you as well, because this is the school report of John Gerdon.</seg>
<seg id="86">["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous."] So they didn't think much of him then.</seg>
<seg id="87">But what you may not know is that he got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago.</seg>
<seg id="88">So to return to the original problem, what is the opportunity of these stem cells, or this disruptive technology, for repairing the damaged brain, which we call regenerative neurology?</seg>
<seg id="89">I think there are two ways you can think about this: as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool, and/or as a form of therapy.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments.</seg>
<seg id="91">Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this.</seg>
<seg id="92">It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease, let's say motor neuron disease, you take a skin sample, you do the pluripotent reprogramming, as I've already told you, and you generate live motor nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="93">That's straightforward, because that's what pluripotent cells can do.</seg>
<seg id="94">But crucially, you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts, ideally from an unaffected relative.</seg>
<seg id="95">That way, you're matching for genetic variation.</seg>
<seg id="96">And that's exactly what we did here.</seg>
<seg id="97">This was a collaboration with colleagues: in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And what you're looking at, and this is amazing, these are living, growing, motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease.</seg>
<seg id="99">It happens to be an inherited form.</seg>
<seg id="100">I mean, just imagine that.</seg>
<seg id="101">This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="102">So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes, we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce, but crucially, we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones.</seg>
<seg id="103">And when you do all that and put it together, you realize that the diseased ones, which is represented in the red line, are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="104">And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs, because what would you ask of the drugs, and you could do this through a high-throughput automated screening system, you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing: find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line, because that drug will be a high-value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models, if that makes sense. It's fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="105">But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage.</seg>
<seg id="106">And again there are two ways to think about this, and they're not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="107">The first, and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend, but it's not thought of that way just yet, is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain, and I've told you that.</seg>
<seg id="108">All of us have stem cells in the brain, even the diseased brain, and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it.</seg>
<seg id="109">That will be the future.</seg>
<seg id="110">There will be drugs that will do that.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells, transplant them in, to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="112">And I want to tell you now an experiment, it's a clinical trial that we did, which recently completed, which is with colleagues in UCL, David Miller in particular.</seg>
<seg id="113">So this study was very simple.</seg>
<seg id="114">We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question: Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves?</seg>
<seg id="115">So what we did was we took this bone marrow, grew up the stem cells in the lab, and then injected them back into the vein.</seg>
<seg id="116">I'm making this sound really simple.</seg>
<seg id="117">It took five years off a lot of people, okay?</seg>
<seg id="118">And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues.</seg>
<seg id="119">But conceptually, it's essentially simple.</seg>
<seg id="120">So we've given them into the vein, right?</seg>
<seg id="121">So in order to measure whether this was successful or not, we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure.</seg>
<seg id="122">And that's a good thing to measure in M.S., because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision -- loss of vision, unclear vision.</seg>
<seg id="123">And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times -- 12 months, six months, and before the infusion -- and you can see the gently declining red line.</seg>
<seg id="124">And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking, which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.</seg>
<seg id="125">We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice -- three months and six months -- and to our surprise, almost, the line's gone up.</seg>
<seg id="126">That suggests that the intervention has been protective.</seg>
<seg id="127">I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves.</seg>
<seg id="128">What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells, to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.</seg>
<seg id="129">So this is a proof of concept.</seg>
<seg id="130">I'm very excited about that.</seg>
<seg id="131">So I just want to end with the theme I began on, which was regeneration and hope.</seg>
<seg id="132">So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future.</seg>
<seg id="133">I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing, we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life.</seg>
<seg id="134">I mean, that speaks volumes.</seg>
<seg id="135">But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John -- thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all.</seg>
<seg id="136">But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.</seg>
<seg id="137">I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope.</seg>
<seg id="138">And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think.</seg>
<seg id="139">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Philip Evans: How data will transform business</title>
<description>What does the future of business look like? In an informative talk, Philip Evans gives a quick primer on two long-standing theories in strategy -- and explains why he thinks they are essentially invalid.</description>
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/696800">Ariana Bleau Lugo</reviewer>
<translator></translator>
<seg id="1">I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology.</seg>
<seg id="2">We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought, perhaps rather timeless.</seg>
<seg id="3">I'm going to argue that, in fact, business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology, that those assumptions are changing, and, in fact, changing quite dramatically, and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let me start, if I may, with a little bit of history.</seg>
<seg id="5">The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants: Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG, and Michael Porter, professor at the Harvard Business School.</seg>
<seg id="6">Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.</seg>
<seg id="7">What Henderson recognized was that,</seg>
<seg id="8">in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns -- scale, experience.</seg>
<seg id="9">The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get.</seg>
<seg id="10">And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world.</seg>
<seg id="12">Porter agreed with that premise, but he qualified it.</seg>
<seg id="13">He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well, but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.</seg>
<seg id="14">They have different components, and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy.</seg>
<seg id="15">A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others.</seg>
<seg id="16">He formed the concept of the value chain, essentially the sequence of steps with which a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component, becomes assembled into a finished product, and then is distributed, for example, and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components, and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts.</seg>
<seg id="17">And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs, that in essence you need to coordinate, organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets, very often, and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.</seg>
<seg id="20">First of all, let's think about transaction costs.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are really two components to transaction costs.</seg>
<seg id="22">One is about processing information, and the other is about communication.</seg>
<seg id="23">These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time.</seg>
<seg id="24">As we all know from so many contexts, they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories.</seg>
<seg id="25">In particular, since the mid-'90s, communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs, which is why communication, the Internet, has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now, those falling transaction costs have profound consequences, because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together, and they are falling,</seg>
<seg id="27">there is less to economize on.</seg>
<seg id="28">There is less need for vertically integrated organization, and value chains at least can break up.</seg>
<seg id="29">They needn't necessarily, but they can.</seg>
<seg id="30">In particular, it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is not just an abstract proposition.</seg>
<seg id="32">There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened.</seg>
<seg id="33">A poster child example was the encyclopedia business.</seg>
<seg id="34">The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen.</seg>
<seg id="36">The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along, new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper, and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's now, of course, a very familiar story.</seg>
<seg id="38">This, in fact, more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation, or what we call deconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="40">One of the questions I was occasionally asked was, well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model?</seg>
<seg id="41">And it was a while before the answer became manifest.</seg>
<seg id="42">Now, of course, we know what it is: it's the Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="44">What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia created by its users.</seg>
<seg id="46">And this, in fact, defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy, the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb.</seg>
<seg id="47">It became a set of conversations, the era in which user-generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="48">Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job, and certainly a much cheaper job, than professionals in a hierarchical organization.</seg>
<seg id="50">So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented, as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="51">But there's another question that obviously this graph poses, which is, okay, we've gone through two decades -- does anything distinguish the third?</seg>
<seg id="52">And what I'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third, and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter-Henderson logic that we've been talking about.</seg>
<seg id="53">And that is, about data.</seg>
<seg id="54">If we go back to around 2000, a lot of people were talking about the information revolution, and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing, indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.</seg>
<seg id="55">We go forward to 2007,</seg>
<seg id="56">not only had the world's stock of data exploded, but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog.</seg>
<seg id="57">And more important even than that, if you look more carefully at this graph, what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's on a server or it's on a P.C.</seg>
<seg id="59">But having an I.P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an I.P. address.</seg>
<seg id="60">It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns, an entirely new thing.</seg>
<seg id="61">If we run the numbers forward to today, it probably looks something like this.</seg>
<seg id="62">We're not really sure.</seg>
<seg id="63">If we run the numbers forward to 2020, we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.</seg>
<seg id="64">It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present.</seg>
<seg id="65">And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an I.P. address.</seg>
<seg id="66">Now, if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points, a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten-thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data, this just in the last 10 or 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="67">This, I would submit, is a sea change, a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in.</seg>
<seg id="68">The first human genome, that of James Watson, was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000, and it took about 200 million dollars and about 10 years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup.</seg>
<seg id="69">Since then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed, to the point where the cost is now below 1,000 dollars, and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015 it will be below 100 dollars -- a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a 15-year period, an extraordinary phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="71">Now, in the days when mapping a genome cost millions, or even tens of thousands, it was basically a research enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="72">Scientists would gather some representative people, and they would see patterns, and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="73">But when the genome can be mapped for 100 bucks, 99 dollars while you wait, then what happens is, it becomes retail.</seg>
<seg id="74">It becomes above all clinical.</seg>
<seg id="75">You go the doctor with a cold, and if he or she hasn't done it already, the first thing they do is map your genome, at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you, but they're starting from your particular genome.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now think of the power of that.</seg>
<seg id="77">Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting.</seg>
<seg id="78">Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.</seg>
<seg id="79">This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while, but this will drive a revolution in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="80">Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention.</seg>
<seg id="82">How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today?</seg>
<seg id="83">If your business is based on proprietary data, if your competitive advantage is defined by your data, how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology?</seg>
<seg id="84">They can't.</seg>
<seg id="85">So essentially what's happening here, and genomics is merely one example of this, is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it, and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. </seg>
<seg id="86">The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.</seg>
<seg id="87">Why is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="88">It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing.</seg>
<seg id="89">The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate.</seg>
<seg id="90">The polarization of scale economies towards the very small -- small is beautiful -- allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production.</seg>
<seg id="91">The scaling in the opposite direction, towards things like big data, drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale.</seg>
<seg id="92">But either way, the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="93">The logic isn't just about big data.</seg>
<seg id="94">If we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry, you can tell the same story about fiber optics.</seg>
<seg id="95">If we look at the pharmaceutical industry, or, for that matter, university research, you can say exactly the same story about so-called "big science."</seg>
<seg id="96">And in the opposite direction, if we look, say, at the energy sector, where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy, that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="97">That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale.</seg>
<seg id="98">Either way, what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries, and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy.</seg>
<seg id="99">It means, for example, that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure, where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy, not something that the strategy presupposes.</seg>
<seg id="100">It means, for example, we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="101">Think about the genome.</seg>
<seg id="102">We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="103">And we need industry structures that will accommodate very, very different motivations, from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments, or, for that matter, cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing, because that is the only way that they can get to scale.</seg>
<seg id="104">These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises of business strategy obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="105">They drive us into a completely new world.</seg>
<seg id="106">They require us, whether we are in the public sector or the private sector, to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business, and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.</seg>
<seg id="107">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Edward Snowden: Here's how we take back the Internet</title>
<description>Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom. The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives — and the laws that protect it. "Your rights matter,” he says, "because you never know when you're going to need them." Chris Anderson interviews, with special guest Tim Berners-Lee.</description>

<seg id="1">The rights of citizens, the future of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2">So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations, Ed Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop, so he can see what the bot can see.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ed, welcome to the TED stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ha, I can see everyone.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ed, some questions for you.</seg>
<seg id="8">You've been called many things in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="9">You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor, a hero.</seg>
<seg id="10">What words would you describe yourself with?</seg>
<seg id="11">You know, everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I think about it, this isn't the question that we should be struggling with.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who I am really doesn't matter at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I'm the worst person in the world, you can hate me and move on.</seg>
<seg id="15">What really matters here are the issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">What really matters here is the kind of government we want, the kind of Internet we want, the kind of relationship between people and societies.</seg>
<seg id="17">And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards, and we've seen that increasing over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">If I had to describe myself, I wouldn't use words like "hero."</seg>
<seg id="19">I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."</seg>
<seg id="20">I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen, just like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="21">So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story -- — this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a sysadmin, you had access to their systems, and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, what propelled you to do this?</seg>
<seg id="24">You know, when I was sitting in Hawaii, and the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community, I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.</seg>
<seg id="25">We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community, things that need to be done, and things that help everyone.</seg>
<seg id="26">But there are also things that go too far.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are things that shouldn't be done, and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness, without the public's consent, and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs.</seg>
<seg id="28">When I really came to struggle with these issues, I thought to myself, how can I do this in the most responsible way, that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks?</seg>
<seg id="29">And out of all the solutions that I could come up with, out of going to Congress, when there were no laws, there were no legal protections for a private employee, a contractor in intelligence like myself, there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out.</seg>
<seg id="30">But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason, and that's to enable an adversarial press, to challenge the government, but also to work together with the government, to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk.</seg>
<seg id="31">And by working with journalists, by giving all of my information back to the American people, rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication, we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="32">And the risks that have been threatened, the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized.</seg>
<seg id="33">We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm, and because of that, I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.</seg>
<seg id="34">So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If we could have a slide up, and Ed, I don't know whether you can see, the slides are here.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is a slide of the PRISM program, and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="37">The best way to understand PRISM, because there's been a little bit of controversy, is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.</seg>
<seg id="38">Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata.</seg>
<seg id="39">They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata, and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.</seg>
<seg id="40">That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping, mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records, things like that -- who you're talking to, when you're talking to them, where you traveled.</seg>
<seg id="41">These are all metadata events.</seg>
<seg id="42">PRISM is about content.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America, it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="44">And even though some of these companies did resist, even though some of them -- I believe Yahoo was one of them — challenged them in court, they all lost, because it was never tried by an open court.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were only tried by a secret court.</seg>
<seg id="46">And something that we've seen, something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is, there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said 15 federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful, but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered 34,000 warrant requests over 33 years, and in 33 years only rejected 11 government requests.</seg>
<seg id="47">These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be.</seg>
<seg id="48">Now, this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies, Internet companies, are alleged to have joined the program, and where data collection began from them.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="50">How was that data collected by the NSA?</seg>
<seg id="51">Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access.</seg>
<seg id="52">What that means to an actual NSA analyst, someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers, things like that, in Hawaii, is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers.</seg>
<seg id="53">It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back-room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now each company handles it different ways.</seg>
<seg id="55">Some are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some are somewhat less responsible.</seg>
<seg id="57">But the bottom line is, when we talk about how this information is given, it's coming from the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's not stolen from the lines.</seg>
<seg id="59">But there's an important thing to remember here: even though companies pushed back, even though companies demanded, hey, let's do this through a warrant process, let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review, some sort of basis for handing over these users' data, we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself.</seg>
<seg id="60">So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA, the NSA isn't satisfied with that, and because of that, we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user, and also advocate for the rights of the users.</seg>
<seg id="61">And I think over the last year, we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that, and I encourage them to continue.</seg>
<seg id="62">What more should they do?</seg>
<seg id="63">The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today, right now, without consulting with lawyers, to protect the rights of users worldwide, is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit.</seg>
<seg id="64">The reason this matters is today, if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com, the NSA can see a record of that, the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that, the Chinese service can see a record of that, the French service, the German service, the services of Andorra.</seg>
<seg id="65">They can all see it because it's unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="66">The world's library is Amazon.com, but not only do they not support encryption by default, you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books.</seg>
<seg id="67">This is something that we need to change, not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out, but they're a great example.</seg>
<seg id="68">All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own.</seg>
<seg id="69">That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="70">Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.</seg>
<seg id="71">I want to show you the next slide here.</seg>
<seg id="72">This is a program called Boundless Informant.</seg>
<seg id="73">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="74">So, I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this.</seg>
<seg id="75">This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.</seg>
<seg id="76">Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.</seg>
<seg id="77">The NSA was previously asked by Congress, was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications They said no. They said, we don't track those stats, and we can't track those stats.</seg>
<seg id="78">We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world, because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy.</seg>
<seg id="79">Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them, but the reality, when you look at this slide is, not only do they have the capability, the capability already exists.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's already in place.</seg>
<seg id="81">The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication, and if it says, this communication came from America, they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today, right now.</seg>
<seg id="82">And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians.</seg>
<seg id="83">I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post, again from your data.</seg>
<seg id="85">The headline says, "NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year."</seg>
<seg id="86">Tell us about that.</seg>
<seg id="87">We also heard in Congressional testimony last year, it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents, knows what's in them, to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses, that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules, when we knew this story was coming.</seg>
<seg id="88">But what's especially interesting about this, about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules, their own laws thousands of times in a single year, including one event by itself, one event out of those 2,776, that affected more than 3,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="89">In another event, they intercepted all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.</seg>
<seg id="90">What's amazing about this, this report, that didn't get that much attention, is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report.</seg>
<seg id="91">And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it, but had never seen this before that.</seg>
<seg id="92">What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year?</seg>
<seg id="93">Ed, one response to this whole debate is this: Why should we care about all this surveillance, honestly?</seg>
<seg id="94">I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="95">What's wrong with that point of view?</seg>
<seg id="96">Well, so the first thing is, you're giving up your rights.</seg>
<seg id="97">You're saying hey, you know, I don't think I'm going to need them, so I'm just going to trust that, you know, let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter, these guys are going to do the right thing.</seg>
<seg id="98">Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them.</seg>
<seg id="99">Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity, not just in America, but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world.</seg>
<seg id="100">People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family, people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones, people should be able to buy a book online, they should be able to travel by train, they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government, possibly not even your government years in the future, how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were.</seg>
<seg id="101">We have a right to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="102">We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody, any government authority, with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some people are furious at what you've done.</seg>
<seg id="104">I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite, Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog.</seg>
<seg id="105">He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history.</seg>
<seg id="106">What would you say to people who think that?</seg>
<seg id="107">Dick Cheney's really something else.</seg>
<seg id="108">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="109">I think it's amazing, because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work, Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide, the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off, and now he's saying it's a flea bite.</seg>
<seg id="110">So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials.</seg>
<seg id="111">But let's assume that these people really believe this.</seg>
<seg id="112">I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security.</seg>
<seg id="113">The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe.</seg>
<seg id="114">The public interest is not always the same as the national interest.</seg>
<seg id="115">Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe, and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="116">The Internet is not the enemy.</seg>
<seg id="117">Our economy is not the enemy.</seg>
<seg id="118">American businesses, Chinese businesses, and any other company out there is a part of our society.</seg>
<seg id="119">It's a part of our interconnected world.</seg>
<seg id="120">There are ties of fraternity that bond us together, and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards, the security, the manner of behavior, that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by.</seg>
<seg id="121">But it's alleged that you've stolen 1.7 million documents.</seg>
<seg id="122">It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far.</seg>
<seg id="123">Are there more revelations to come?</seg>
<seg id="124">There are absolutely more revelations to come.</seg>
<seg id="125">I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="126">Come here, because I want to ask you about this particular revelation.</seg>
<seg id="127">Come and take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="128">I mean, this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="129">It's about a program called "Bullrun."</seg>
<seg id="130">Can you explain what that is?</seg>
<seg id="131">So Bullrun, and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor, this is a program named after a Civil War battle.</seg>
<seg id="132">The British counterpart is called Edgehill, which is a U.K. civil war battle.</seg>
<seg id="133">And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="134">They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners.</seg>
<seg id="135">They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards.</seg>
<seg id="136">They say hey, we need to work with you to secure your systems, but in reality, they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services.</seg>
<seg id="137">They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit, but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications.</seg>
<seg id="138">And this is really dangerous, because if we lose a single standard, if we lose the trust of something like SSL, which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program, we will live a less safe world overall.</seg>
<seg id="139">We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends.</seg>
<seg id="140">And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources?</seg>
<seg id="141">Absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="142">One of the problems, one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post-9/11 era, is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.</seg>
<seg id="143">They've been in charge of offensive operations, that is hacking, but they've also been in charge of defensive operations, and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more.</seg>
<seg id="144">If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets, if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets, that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets.</seg>
<seg id="145">So by reducing the security of our communications, they're not only putting the world at risk, they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way, because intellectual property is the basis, the foundation of our economy, and if we put that at risk through weak security, we're going to be paying for it for years.</seg>
<seg id="146">But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="147">Surely that makes it a price worth paying.</seg>
<seg id="148">Well, when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism, you will see that that's unfounded, and you don't have to take my word for it, because we've had the first open court, the first federal court that's reviewed this, outside the secrecy arrangement, called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="149">Congress, who has access to be briefed on these things, and now has the desire to be, has produced bills to reform it, and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="150">So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?</seg>
<seg id="151">Do these programs have any value at all?</seg>
<seg id="152">I say no, and all three branches of the American government say no as well.</seg>
<seg id="153">I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="154">I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?</seg>
<seg id="155">Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action.</seg>
<seg id="157">Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="158">The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs, the NSA asked for these authorities back in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="159">They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case.</seg>
<seg id="160">The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.</seg>
<seg id="161">But Congress and the American people said no.</seg>
<seg id="162">They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.</seg>
<seg id="163">They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains.</seg>
<seg id="164">But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era, they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress, without asking the American people, and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against, because it makes us less safe, and it offers no value.</seg>
<seg id="165">Okay, come with me here for a sec, because I've got a more personal question for you.</seg>
<seg id="166">Speaking of terror, most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="167">You obviously heard what happened, what the treatment that Bradley Manning got, Chelsea Manning as now is, and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead.</seg>
<seg id="168">How are you coping with this?</seg>
<seg id="169">How are you coping with the fear?</seg>
<seg id="170">It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead.</seg>
<seg id="171">I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people.</seg>
<seg id="172">I don't want to harm my government.</seg>
<seg id="173">I want to help my government, but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process, they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial, these are things that we need to work against as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="174">We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.</seg>
<seg id="175">We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.</seg>
<seg id="176">And whatever part I can do to see that end, I'm happy to do despite the risks.</seg>
<seg id="177">So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here, because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="178">Suppose you had the following two choices, right?</seg>
<seg id="179">You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long-term good?</seg>
<seg id="180">Those are the two choices I'll give you.</seg>
<seg id="181">I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those, that this was a reckless act?</seg>
<seg id="182">There are some hands going up.</seg>
<seg id="183">Some hands going up.</seg>
<seg id="184">It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here, but I see them.</seg>
<seg id="185">I can see you.</seg>
<seg id="186">And who goes with the second choice, the fundamentally heroic act?</seg>
<seg id="187">And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through, because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines.</seg>
<seg id="188">It's not left or right, it's not really about pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.</seg>
<seg id="189">Part of it is almost a generational issue.</seg>
<seg id="190">You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="191">Is there some truth to that?</seg>
<seg id="192">It is. I think it's very true.</seg>
<seg id="193">This is not a left or right issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">Our basic freedoms, and when I say our, I don't just mean Americans, I mean people around the world, it's not a partisan issue.</seg>
<seg id="195">These are things that all people believe, and it's up to all of us to protect them, and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet, it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy, and if we don't change things, if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe, not just for us but for everyone, we're going to lose that, and that would be a tremendous loss, not just for us, but for the world.</seg>
<seg id="196">Well, I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web, who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.</seg>
<seg id="197">Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say, do we have a microphone for Tim?</seg>
<seg id="198">Tim, good to see you. Come up there.</seg>
<seg id="199">Which camp are you in, by the way, traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but -- Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer answers to that question, but hero, if I have to make the choice between the two.</seg>
<seg id="200">And Ed, I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="201">Is that something that makes sense?</seg>
<seg id="202">Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up not just thinking about the Internet, but I grew up in the Internet, and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual, almost avatar manner, I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression.</seg>
<seg id="203">And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need.</seg>
<seg id="204">We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet, and it's something that I hope, I invite everyone in the audience, not just here in Vancouver but around the world, to join and participate in.</seg>
<seg id="205">Do you have a question for Ed?</seg>
<seg id="206">Well, two questions, a general question — Ed, can you still hear us?</seg>
<seg id="207">Yes, I can hear you. Oh, he's back.</seg>
<seg id="208">The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="209">It's a little bit of an NSA problem.</seg>
<seg id="210">So, from the 25 years, stepping back and thinking, what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want?</seg>
<seg id="211">When we think about in terms of how far we can go, I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it.</seg>
<seg id="212">I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need, and by cooperating, by engaging not just the technical parts of society, but as you said, the users, the people around the world who contribute through the Internet, through social media, who just check the weather, who rely on it every day as a part of their life, to champion that.</seg>
<seg id="213">We'll get not just the Internet we've had, but a better Internet, a better now, something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="214">It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.</seg>
<seg id="215">A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong.</seg>
<seg id="216">It's not Big Brother watching us.</seg>
<seg id="217">We, through the power of the web, and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.</seg>
<seg id="218">Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view, but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that.</seg>
<seg id="219">And you do too.</seg>
<seg id="220">Right, so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously.</seg>
<seg id="221">There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle, which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude, and each time that occurs, we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights.</seg>
<seg id="222">Now, that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude, and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today, but there is still hope, because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology.</seg>
<seg id="223">I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win, and I think that's something that we need to take hope from, and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world.</seg>
<seg id="224">Journalism is not a crime, communication is not a crime, and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities.</seg>
<seg id="225">I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot, but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here. That'll come very soon.</seg>
<seg id="226">Nice to meet you, and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thank you, Tim.</seg>
<seg id="228">I mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you.</seg>
<seg id="229">Would you welcome the chance to come back to America?</seg>
<seg id="230">Absolutely. There's really no question, the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world, and I think if the press is now saying, we support this, this is something that needed to happen, that's a powerful argument, but it's not the final argument, and I think that's something that public should decide.</seg>
<seg id="231">But at the same time, the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal, that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working, to come back, and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="232">I did this to do what was right, and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself.</seg>
<seg id="233">In the meantime, courtesy of the Internet and this technology, you're here, back in North America, not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.</seg>
<seg id="234">I'm curious, how does that feel?</seg>
<seg id="235">Canada is different than what I expected.</seg>
<seg id="236">It's a lot warmer.</seg>
<seg id="237">At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."</seg>
<seg id="238">If you could encapsulate it in a single idea, what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment?</seg>
<seg id="239">I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors, but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors, and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government.</seg>
<seg id="240">We don't have to give up our liberty to have security.</seg>
<seg id="241">And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives, and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen.</seg>
<seg id="242">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="243">Ed, thank you.</seg>

<title>Larry Page: Where’s Google going next?</title>
<description>Onstage at TED2014, Charlie Rose interviews Google CEO Larry Page about his far-off vision for the company. It includes aerial bikeways and internet balloons … and then it gets even more interesting, as Page talks through the company’s recent acquisition of Deep Mind, an AI that is learning some surprising things.</description>
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/696800">Ariana Bleau Lugo</reviewer>
<translator></translator>
<seg id="1">So Larry sent me an email and he basically said, we've got to make sure that we don't seem like we're a couple of middle-aged boring men.</seg>
<seg id="2">I said, I'm flattered by that -- — because I'm a bit older, and he has a bit more net worth than I do.</seg>
<seg id="3">Well, thank you.</seg>
<seg id="4">So we'll have a conversation about the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google, and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy, and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mainly we want to talk about the future.</seg>
<seg id="6">So my first question: Where is Google and where is it going?</seg>
<seg id="7">Well, this is something we think about a lot,</seg>
<seg id="8">and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.</seg>
<seg id="9">And people always say, is that really what you guys are still doing? And I always kind of think about that myself, and I'm not quite sure.</seg>
<seg id="10">But actually, when I think about search, it's such a deep thing for all of us, to really understand what you want, to understand the world's information, and we're still very much in the early stages of that, which is totally crazy.</seg>
<seg id="11">We've been at it for 15 years already, but it's not at all done.</seg>
<seg id="12">When it's done, how will it be?</seg>
<seg id="13">Well, I guess, in thinking about where we're going -- you know, why is it not done? -- a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess.</seg>
<seg id="14">You know, your computer doesn't know where you are, it doesn't know what you're doing, it doesn't know what you know, and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work, make them understand your context.</seg>
<seg id="15">Google Now, you know, knows where you are, knows what you may need.</seg>
<seg id="16">So really having computing work and understand you and understand that information, we really haven't done that yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's still very, very clunky.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing, where does Deep Mind fit?</seg>
<seg id="19">Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's in the U.K.</seg>
<seg id="21">First, let me tell you the way we got there, which was looking at search and really understanding, trying to understand everything, and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you -- like, voice was really important.</seg>
<seg id="22">So what's the state of the art on speech recognition?</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not very good.</seg>
<seg id="24">It doesn't really understand you.</seg>
<seg id="25">So we started doing machine learning research to improve that.</seg>
<seg id="26">That helped a lot.</seg>
<seg id="27">And we started just looking at things like YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="28">Can we understand YouTube?</seg>
<seg id="29">But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats, just by itself.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, that's an important concept.</seg>
<seg id="31">And we realized there's really something here.</seg>
<seg id="32">If we can learn what cats are, that must be really important.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I think Deep Mind, what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually -- they're learning things in this unsupervised way.</seg>
<seg id="34">They started with video games, and really just, maybe I can show the video, just playing video games, and learning how to do that automatically.</seg>
<seg id="35">Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things.</seg>
<seg id="36">The amazing thing about this is this is, I mean, obviously, these are old games, but the system just sees what you see, the pixels, and it has the controls and it has the score, and it's learned to play all of these games, same program.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance.</seg>
<seg id="38">We've not been able to do things like this with computers before.</seg>
<seg id="39">And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is boxing, and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down.</seg>
<seg id="41">The computer's on the left, and it's just racking up points.</seg>
<seg id="42">So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule, or your information needs, or things like that.</seg>
<seg id="43">We're really just at the beginning of that, and that's what I'm really excited about.</seg>
<seg id="44">When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing, also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="45">Where are we, when you look at that?</seg>
<seg id="46">Well, I think for me, this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time.</seg>
<seg id="47">The guy who started this company, Demis, has a neuroscience and a computer science background.</seg>
<seg id="48">He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain.</seg>
<seg id="49">And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things.</seg>
<seg id="50">But where's the level of it now?</seg>
<seg id="51">And how fast do you think we are moving?</seg>
<seg id="52">Well, this is the state of the art right now, understanding cats on YouTube and things like that, improving voice recognition.</seg>
<seg id="53">We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally, but I think for me, this example's really exciting, because it's one program that can do a lot of different things.</seg>
<seg id="54">I don't know if we can do this, but we've got the image of the cat.</seg>
<seg id="55">It would be wonderful to see this.</seg>
<seg id="56">This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with.</seg>
<seg id="57">Can we see that image?</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeah. There it is. Can you see the cat?</seg>
<seg id="59">Designed by machines, seen by machines.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's right.</seg>
<seg id="61">So this is learned from just watching YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="62">And there's no training, no notion of a cat, but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand, and now that the machines can kind of understand.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe just finishing also on the search part, it started with search, really understanding people's context and their information.</seg>
<seg id="64">I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found.</seg>
<seg id="65">["Soy, Kenya"] Zack Matere: Not long ago, I planted a crop of potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="66">Then suddenly they started dying one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="67">I checked out the books and they didn't tell me much.</seg>
<seg id="68">So, I went and I did a search.</seg>
<seg id="69">["Zack Matere, Farmer"] Potato diseases.</seg>
<seg id="70">One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem.</seg>
<seg id="71">It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.</seg>
<seg id="72">Then after a few days the ants disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="73">I got excited about the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="74">I have this friend who really would like to expand his business.</seg>
<seg id="75">So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites.</seg>
<seg id="76">When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill at the local school.</seg>
<seg id="77">I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there.</seg>
<seg id="78">I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access.</seg>
<seg id="79">I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use.</seg>
<seg id="80">So I thought about a notice board.</seg>
<seg id="81">A simple wooden notice board.</seg>
<seg id="82">When I get information on my phone, I'm able to post the information on the notice board.</seg>
<seg id="83">So it's basically like a computer.</seg>
<seg id="84">I use the Internet to help people.</seg>
<seg id="85">I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="86">So many people have access to information, but there's no follow-up to that.</seg>
<seg id="87">I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="88">When people have the knowledge, they can find solutions without having to helped out.</seg>
<seg id="89">Information is powerful, but it is how we use it that will define us.</seg>
<seg id="90">Now, the amazing thing about that video, actually, was we just read about it in the news, and we found this gentlemen, and made that little clip.</seg>
<seg id="91">When I talk to people about you, they say to me, people who know you well, say, Larry wants to change the world, and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="92">It has to do with languages.</seg>
<seg id="93">It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community, and this is an example.</seg>
<seg id="94">Yeah, that's right, and I think for me,</seg>
<seg id="95">I have been focusing on access more, if we're talking about the future.</seg>
<seg id="96">We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it.</seg>
<seg id="97">It sounds totally crazy.</seg>
<seg id="98">We can show the video here.</seg>
<seg id="99">Actually, two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now.</seg>
<seg id="100">We actually think this can really help people sort of cost-efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="101">It's a balloon. Yeah, get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="102">And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="103">Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible, they didn't have to be tethered.</seg>
<seg id="104">Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation.</seg>
<seg id="105">Like, we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it, but it was just really, how do we get access points up high, cheaply?</seg>
<seg id="106">You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them.</seg>
<seg id="107">But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up, and actually again, it's the power of the Internet, I did a search on it, and I found, 30, 40 years ago, someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="108">And I thought, why can't we do that today?</seg>
<seg id="109">And that's how this project got going.</seg>
<seg id="110">But are you at the mercy of the wind?</seg>
<seg id="111">Yeah, but it turns out, we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before, and if you control the altitude of the balloons, which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways, you can actually control roughly where they go, and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet.</seg>
<seg id="112">Before I talk about the future and transportation, where you've been a nerd for a while, and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles, let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="113">It is security and privacy.</seg>
<seg id="114">You have to have been thinking about that.</seg>
<seg id="115">Yeah, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="116">I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="117">Some of you may have seen it.</seg>
<seg id="118">But I think, for me, I guess, privacy and security are a really important thing.</seg>
<seg id="119">We think about it in terms of both things, and I think you can't have privacy without security, so let me just talk about security first, because you asked about Snowden and all of that, and then I'll say a little bit about privacy.</seg>
<seg id="120">I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.</seg>
<seg id="121">I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about.</seg>
<seg id="122">And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from, but we do need to know what the parameters of it is, what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why, and I think we haven't had that conversation.</seg>
<seg id="123">So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret.</seg>
<seg id="124">Never coming to Google to ask for anything.</seg>
<seg id="125">Not Google, but the public.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think we need to have a debate about that, or we can't have a functioning democracy.</seg>
<seg id="127">It's just not possible.</seg>
<seg id="128">So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about.</seg>
<seg id="129">It doesn't make any sense.</seg>
<seg id="130">Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.</seg>
<seg id="131">Yes. The privacy side,</seg>
<seg id="132">I think it's -- the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="133">You carry a phone. It knows where you are.</seg>
<seg id="134">There's so much more information about you, and that's an important thing, and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions.</seg>
<seg id="135">We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are.</seg>
<seg id="136">I'm a little bit -- I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice, show them what data's being collected -- search history, location data.</seg>
<seg id="137">We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome, and doing that in more ways, just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="138">I also think it's very easy.</seg>
<seg id="139">What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater.</seg>
<seg id="140">And I look at, on your show, actually, I kind of lost my voice, and I haven't gotten it back.</seg>
<seg id="141">I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back.</seg>
<seg id="142">If I could do anything, I would do that.</seg>
<seg id="143">All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do.</seg>
<seg id="144">But I think, you know what, I look at that, I made that public, and I got all this information.</seg>
<seg id="145">We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues, and I look at medical records, and I say, wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors?</seg>
<seg id="146">And when someone accesses your medical record, a research doctor, they could see, you could see which doctor accessed it and why, and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have.</seg>
<seg id="147">I think if we just did that, we'd save 100,000 lives this year.</seg>
<seg id="148">Absolutely. Let me go — So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy, we're doing the same thing we're doing with medical records, is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways.</seg>
<seg id="149">And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused.</seg>
<seg id="150">Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff.</seg>
<seg id="151">I was scared to share it.</seg>
<seg id="152">Sergey encouraged me to do that, and it was a great thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="153">And the response has been overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="154">Yeah, and people are super positive.</seg>
<seg id="155">We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions, which there's no data on today.</seg>
<seg id="156">So it was a really good thing.</seg>
<seg id="157">So talking about the future, what is it about you and transportation systems?</seg>
<seg id="158">Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="159">I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it.</seg>
<seg id="160">And it was cold and snowing.</seg>
<seg id="161">I did some research on how much it cost, and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems.</seg>
<seg id="162">And that began the idea of an automated car.</seg>
<seg id="163">Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about people working on automated cars, and I became fascinated by that, and it takes a while to get these projects going, but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world.</seg>
<seg id="164">There's 20 million people or more injured per year.</seg>
<seg id="165">It's the leading cause of death for people under 34 in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="166">So you're talking about saving lives.</seg>
<seg id="167">Yeah, and also saving space and making life better.</seg>
<seg id="168">Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads, half of the area, and most cities are not far behind, actually.</seg>
<seg id="169">It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for.</seg>
<seg id="170">And how soon will we be there?</seg>
<seg id="171">I think we can be there very, very soon.</seg>
<seg id="172">We've driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated.</seg>
<seg id="173">I'm super excited about getting that out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="174">But it's not only you're talking about automated cars.</seg>
<seg id="175">You also have this idea for bicycles.</seg>
<seg id="176">Well at Google, we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone, and that's been amazing, most of the trips.</seg>
<seg id="177">You see bikes going everywhere, and the bikes wear out.</seg>
<seg id="178">They're getting used 24 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="179">But you want to put them above the street, too.</seg>
<seg id="180">Well I said, how do we get people using bikes more?</seg>
<seg id="181">We may have a video here.</seg>
<seg id="182">Yeah, let's show the video.</seg>
<seg id="183">I just got excited about this.</seg>
<seg id="184">So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost.</seg>
<seg id="185">Anyway, it looks totally crazy, but I was actually thinking about our campus, working with the Zippies and stuff, and just trying to get a lot more bike usage, and I was thinking about, how do you cost-effectively separate the bikes from traffic?</seg>
<seg id="186">And I went and searched, and this is what I found.</seg>
<seg id="187">And we're not actually working on this, that particular thing, but it gets your imagination going.</seg>
<seg id="188">Let me close with this.</seg>
<seg id="189">Give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind.</seg>
<seg id="190">You have this idea of [Google X].</seg>
<seg id="191">You don't simply want to go in some small, measurable arena of progress.</seg>
<seg id="192">Yeah, I think many of the things we just talked about are like that, where they're really -- I almost use the economic concept of additionality, which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless you were actually doing it.</seg>
<seg id="193">And I think the more you can do things like that, the bigger impact you have, and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible.</seg>
<seg id="194">And I've been amazed, the more I learn about technology, the more I realize I don't know, and that's because this technological horizon, the thing that you can see to do next, the more you learn about technology, the more you learn what's possible.</seg>
<seg id="195">You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them.</seg>
<seg id="196">What's interesting about you too, though, for me, is that, we have lots of people who are thinking about the future, and they are going and looking and they're coming back, but we never see the implementation.</seg>
<seg id="197">I think of somebody you knew and read about, Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="198">The principle of that for you is what?</seg>
<seg id="199">Well, I think invention is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="200">If you invent something, Tesla invented electric power that we use, but he struggled to get it out to people.</seg>
<seg id="201">That had to be done by other people.</seg>
<seg id="202">It took a long time.</seg>
<seg id="203">And I think if we can actually combine both things, where we have an innovation and invention focus, plus the ability to really -- a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope.</seg>
<seg id="204">You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that, because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good.</seg>
<seg id="205">Which is a second thing about corporations.</seg>
<seg id="206">You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well.</seg>
<seg id="207">Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil.</seg>
<seg id="208">They get a bad rap.</seg>
<seg id="209">And I think that's somewhat correct.</seg>
<seg id="210">Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did 50 years ago or 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="211">That's not really what we need.</seg>
<seg id="212">We need, especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change.</seg>
<seg id="213">You once said, actually, as I think I've got this about right, that you might consider, rather than giving your money, if you were leaving it to some cause, just simply giving it to Elon Musk, because you had confidence that he would change the future, and that you would therefore — Yeah, if you want to go Mars, he wants to go to Mars, to back up humanity, that's a worthy goal, but it's a company, and it's philanthropical.</seg>
<seg id="214">So I think we aim to do kind of similar things.</seg>
<seg id="215">And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy.</seg>
<seg id="216">People make a lot of money in technology.</seg>
<seg id="217">A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy.</seg>
<seg id="218">You're working because you want to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="219">You want to make it better.</seg>
<seg id="220">Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well?</seg>
<seg id="221">I mean, but we don't have a concept of that.</seg>
<seg id="222">That's not how we think about companies, and I think it's sad, because companies are most of our effort.</seg>
<seg id="223">They're where most of people's time is, where a lot of the money is, and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I close conversations with lots of people, I always ask this question: What state of mind, what quality of mind is it that has served you best?</seg>
<seg id="225">People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity, and other people in the media have said that.</seg>
<seg id="226">Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus.</seg>
<seg id="227">What quality of mind, as I leave this audience, has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present?</seg>
<seg id="228">You know, I think the most important thing -- I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time.</seg>
<seg id="229">We've had a more rapid turnover of companies.</seg>
<seg id="230">And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="231">What did those companies all do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="232">And usually it's just that they missed the future.</seg>
<seg id="233">And so I think, for me, I just try to focus on that and say, what is that future really going to be and how do we create it, and how do we cause our organization, to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate?</seg>
<seg id="234">And so that's been curiosity, it's been looking at things people might not think about, working on things that no one else is working on, because that's where the additionality really is, and be willing to do that, to take that risk.</seg>
<seg id="235">Look at Android.</seg>
<seg id="236">I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting.</seg>
<seg id="237">It was a little startup we bought.</seg>
<seg id="238">It wasn't really what we were really working on.</seg>
<seg id="239">And I felt guilty about spending time on that.</seg>
<seg id="240">That was stupid.</seg>
<seg id="241">That was the future, right?</seg>
<seg id="242">That was a good thing to be working on.</seg>
<seg id="243">It is great to see you here.</seg>
<seg id="244">It's great to hear from you, and a pleasure to sit at this table with you.</seg>
<seg id="245">Thanks, Larry.</seg>
<seg id="246">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Michel Laberge: How synchronized hammer strikes could generate nuclear fusion</title>
<description>Our energy future depends on nuclear fusion, says Michel Laberge. The plasma physicist runs a small company with a big idea for a new type of nuclear reactor that could produce clean, cheap energy. His secret recipe? High speeds, scorching temperatures and crushing pressure. In this hopeful talk, he explains how nuclear fusion might be just around the corner.</description>

<seg id="1">Wow, this is bright.</seg>
<seg id="2">It must use a lot of power.</seg>
<seg id="3">Well, flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too.</seg>
<seg id="4">So the whole planet needs a lot of energy, and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.</seg>
<seg id="5">We've been burning gas.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's been a good run.</seg>
<seg id="7">It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="8">We can't do that anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">So we are trying different types of energy now, alternative energy, but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as cost-effective as oil, gas and coal.</seg>
<seg id="10">My personal favorite is nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, it's very energy-dense, it produces solid, reliable power, and it doesn't make any CO2.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now we know of two ways of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now in fission, you take a big nucleus, you break it in part, in two, and it makes lots of energy,</seg>
<seg id="14">and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.</seg>
<seg id="15">It works pretty good.</seg>
<seg id="16">And then there's fusion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.</seg>
<seg id="18">So you take two small nuclei, you put it together, and you make helium, and that's very nice.</seg>
<seg id="19">It makes lots of energy.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is nature's way of producing energy.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, a fusion plant would actually be quite cost-effective and it also would be quite safe.</seg>
<seg id="23">It only produces short term radioactive waste, and it cannot melt down.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the ocean, you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if the whole planet would run on fusion, we could extract the fuel from the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="27">It would run for billions and billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Where is it?</seg>
<seg id="30">Well, there's always a bit of a catch.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fusion is really, really hard to do.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the problem is, those two nuclei, they are both positively charged, so they don't want to fuse.</seg>
<seg id="33">They go like this. They go like that.</seg>
<seg id="34">So in order to make them fuse, you have to throw them at each other with great speed, and if they have enough speed, they will go against the repulsion, they will touch, and they will make energy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, the particle speed is a measure of the temperature.</seg>
<seg id="36">So the temperature required for fusion is 150 billion degrees C.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is rather warm, and this is why fusion is so hard to do.</seg>
<seg id="38">Now, I caught my little fusion bug when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia,</seg>
<seg id="39">and then I got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry.</seg>
<seg id="40">I worked there for 10 years, and I got a little bit bored, and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,</seg>
<seg id="41">you know, the usual thing: Who am I? What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="42">What should I do? What can I do?</seg>
<seg id="43">And then I was looking at my good work,</seg>
<seg id="44">and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests around here in B.C. and burying you, all of you, in millions of tons of junk mail.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now, that was not very satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="46">So some people buy a Porsche.</seg>
<seg id="47">Others get a mistress.</seg>
<seg id="48">But I've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now, so the first thing I did is I looked into the literature and I see, how does fusion work?</seg>
<seg id="50">So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while,</seg>
<seg id="51">and one of the ways they do it is with something called a tokamak.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's a big ring of magnetic coil, superconducting coil, and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this, and the hot gas in the middle, which is called a plasma, is trapped.</seg>
<seg id="53">The particles go round and round and round the circle at the wall.</seg>
<seg id="54">Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there to try to cook that to fusion temperature.</seg>
<seg id="55">So this is the inside of one of those donuts, and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now, a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball, you put the fusion fuel in the center, and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it.</seg>
<seg id="58">The lasers are very strong, and it squashes the ping pong ball really, really quick.</seg>
<seg id="59">And if you squeeze something hard enough, it gets hotter, and if it gets really, really fast, and they do that in one billionth of a second, it makes enough energy and enough heat to make fusion.</seg>
<seg id="60">So this is the inside of one such machine.</seg>
<seg id="61">You see the laser beam and the pellet in the center.</seg>
<seg id="62">Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="63">They always think that the physicists are in their lab and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.</seg>
<seg id="64">That's actually not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last 30 years or so,</seg>
<seg id="66">and you can see that we're making now about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to when we started.</seg>
<seg id="67">That's a pretty good gain.</seg>
<seg id="68">As a matter of fact, it's as fast as the fabled Moore's Law that defined the amount of transistors they can put on a chip.</seg>
<seg id="69">Now, this dot here is called JET, the Joint European Torus.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,</seg>
<seg id="71">and this machine in 1997 produced 16 megawatts of fusion power with 17 megawatts of heat.</seg>
<seg id="72">Now, you say, that's not much use, but it's actually pretty close, considering we can get about 10,000 times more than we started.</seg>
<seg id="73">The second dot here is the NIF.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's the National Ignition Facility.</seg>
<seg id="75">It's a big laser machine in the U.S., and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now, that's not quite good enough, because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that, but it was pretty good.</seg>
<seg id="77">Now this is ITER, pronounced in French: EE-tairh.</seg>
<seg id="78">So this is a big collaboration of different countries that are building a huge magnetic donut in the south of France, and this machine, when it's finished, will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power with only 50 megawatts to make it.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's going to work.</seg>
<seg id="80">That's the kind of machine that makes energy.</seg>
<seg id="81">Now if you look at the graph, you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the right of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="82">We kind of have fallen off the progress.</seg>
<seg id="83">Actually, the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, there has been a bit of politics going on, and the will to do it was not there,</seg>
<seg id="85">so it drifted to the right.</seg>
<seg id="86">ITER, for example, could have been built in 2000 or 2005, but because it's a big international collaboration, the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.</seg>
<seg id="87">For example, it took them about three years to decide where to put it.</seg>
<seg id="88">Now, fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="89">Yes, it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress.</seg>
<seg id="90">But you have to compare that to the cost of making Moore's Law.</seg>
<seg id="91">That cost way more than that.</seg>
<seg id="92">The result of Moore's Law is this cell phone here in my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="93">This cell phone, and the Internet behind it, cost about one trillion dollars, just so I can take a selfie and put it on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="94">Then when my dad sees that, he'll be very proud.</seg>
<seg id="95">We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy.</seg>
<seg id="96">Now, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.</seg>
<seg id="97">So me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="98">I think it's actually been shortchanged, considering it can solve all our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="99">Now I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased, because I started a fusion company and I don't even have a Facebook account.</seg>
<seg id="100">So when I started this fusion company in 2002, I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.</seg>
<seg id="101">They had much more resources than me.</seg>
<seg id="102">So I decided I would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster.</seg>
<seg id="103">Now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines.</seg>
<seg id="104">They are awesome pieces of technology, wonderful machines, and they have shown that fusion can be done.</seg>
<seg id="105">However, as a power plant, I don't think they're very good.</seg>
<seg id="106">They're way too big, way too complicated,</seg>
<seg id="107">way too expensive,</seg>
<seg id="108">and also, they don't deal very much with the fusion energy.</seg>
<seg id="109">When you make fusion, the energy comes out as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="110">Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="111">It damages it.</seg>
<seg id="112">And also, you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,</seg>
<seg id="113">and on those machines, it was all a bit of an afterthought.</seg>
<seg id="114">So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that.</seg>
<seg id="115">So back to the literature, and I read about the fusion everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="116">One way in particular attracted my attention,</seg>
<seg id="117">and it's called magnetized target fusion, or MTF for short.</seg>
<seg id="118">Now, in MTF, what you want to do is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal,</seg>
<seg id="119">and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center, a bit like your sink. When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.</seg>
<seg id="120">And then you have some pistons driven by pressure and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma, and it compresses it,</seg>
<seg id="121">it gets hotter, like a laser, and then it makes fusion.</seg>
<seg id="122">So it's a bit of a mix between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion.</seg>
<seg id="123">So those have a couple of very good advantages.</seg>
<seg id="124">The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall, and therefore there's no damage to the machine.</seg>
<seg id="125">The liquid metal gets hot, make some steam, spin a turbine.</seg>
<seg id="126">So that's a very convenient way of doing this part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="127">And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from steam-powered pistons, which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils.</seg>
<seg id="128">Now, this was all very good except for the problem that it didn't quite work.</seg>
<seg id="129">There's always a catch.</seg>
<seg id="130">So when you compress that, the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed,</seg>
<seg id="131">so you're trying to compress it, but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing.</seg>
<seg id="132">So when I saw that, I said, well, this is such a shame, because it's a very, very good idea.</seg>
<seg id="133">So hopefully I can improve on that.</seg>
<seg id="134">So I thought about it for a minute, and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?</seg>
<seg id="135">So then I thought about impact.</seg>
<seg id="136">What about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this, in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.</seg>
<seg id="137">So what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we accelerate the pistons with steam, that takes a little bit of time, but then, bang! you hit the piston, and, baff!, all the energy is done instantly, down instantly to the liquid, and that compresses the plasma much faster.</seg>
<seg id="139">So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.</seg>
<seg id="140">So we built this machine in this garage here.</seg>
<seg id="141">We made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that, and those are my marketing neutrons, and with those marketing neutrons, then I raised about 50 million dollars, and I hired 65 people. That's my team here.</seg>
<seg id="142">And this is what we want to build.</seg>
<seg id="143">So it's going to be a big machine, about three meters in diameter, liquid lead spinning around, big vortex in the center, put the plasma on the top and on the bottom, piston hits on the side, bang!, it compresses it, and it will make some energy, and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal, going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine, and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston.</seg>
<seg id="144">We're going to run that about one time per second, and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="145">Okay, we also built this injector, so this injector makes the plasma to start with.</seg>
<seg id="146">It makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.</seg>
<seg id="147">Unfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,</seg>
<seg id="148">so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit,</seg>
<seg id="149">but last month it got a lot better, so I think we have the plasma compressing now.</seg>
<seg id="150">Then we built a small sphere, about this big, 14 pistons around it, and this will compress the liquid.</seg>
<seg id="151">However, plasma is difficult to compress.</seg>
<seg id="152">When you compress it, it tends to go a little bit crooked like that, so you need the timing of the piston to be very good,</seg>
<seg id="153">and for that we use several control systems, which was not possible in 1970,</seg>
<seg id="154">but we now can do that with nice, new electronics.</seg>
<seg id="155">So finally, most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen,</seg>
<seg id="156">but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.</seg>
<seg id="157">We are almost there.</seg>
<seg id="158">The big labs have shown that fusion is doable, and now there are small companies that are thinking about that, and they say, it's not that it cannot be done, but it's how to make it cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="159">General Fusion is one of those small companies,</seg>
<seg id="160">and hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone, will crack that nut, and perhaps it will be General Fusion. Thank you very much.</seg>

<title>Nicholas Negroponte: A 30-year history of the future</title>
<description>MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte takes you on a journey through the last 30 years of tech. The consummate predictor highlights interfaces and innovations he foresaw in the 1970s and 1980s that were scoffed at then but are ubiquitous today. And he leaves you with one last (absurd? brilliant?) prediction for the coming 30 years.</description>

<translator></translator>
<seg id="1">Can we switch to the video disc, which is in play mode?</seg>
<seg id="2">I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.</seg>
<seg id="3">We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Music, crosstalk) Very interested in touch-sensitive displays, high-tech, high-touch, not having to pick up your fingers to use them.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is another way where computers touch people: wearing, physically wearing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Suddenly on September 11th, the world got bigger.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thank you. Thank you. When I was asked to do this, I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks that I had given, chronologically.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first one was actually two hours.</seg>
<seg id="9">The second one was an hour, and then they became half hours, and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by, and it was, to say the least, for me, quite a shocking experience.</seg>
<seg id="11">So what I'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the 30 years, and then also make a prediction, and then tell you a little bit about what I'm doing next.</seg>
<seg id="12">And I put on a slide where TED 1 happened in my life.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it's rather important because I had done 15 years of research before it, so I had a backlog, so it was easy.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's not that I was Fidel Castro and I could talk for two hours, or Bucky Fuller.</seg>
<seg id="15">I had 15 years of stuff, and the Media Lab was about to start.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that was easy.</seg>
<seg id="17">But there are a couple of things about that period and about what happened that are really quite important.</seg>
<seg id="18">One is that it was a period when computers weren't yet for people.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer scientists.</seg>
<seg id="20">We weren't considered the real thing.</seg>
<seg id="21">So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect, a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">So I'm going to characterize the years and I'm even going to go back to some very early work of mine,</seg>
<seg id="23">and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s: very direct manipulation, very influenced as I studied architecture by the architect Moshe Safdie,</seg>
<seg id="24">and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat-like structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">And this for me was not yet the Media Lab, but was the beginning of what I'll call sensory computing,</seg>
<seg id="26">and I pick fingers partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="27">Papers were published about how stupid it was to use fingers. Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.</seg>
<seg id="28">The other is your hand would occlude what you wanted to see, and the third, which was the winner, was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,</seg>
<seg id="29">and hence, fingers would never be a device that you'd use.</seg>
<seg id="30">And this was a device we built in the '70s, which has never even been picked up.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's not just touch sensitive, it's pressure sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="32">Put a yellow circle there.</seg>
<seg id="33">Later work, and again this was before TED 1 —</seg>
<seg id="34">Move that west of the diamond.</seg>
<seg id="35">Create a large green circle there.</seg>
<seg id="36">Aw, shit.</seg>
<seg id="37">— was to sort of do interface concurrently, so when you talked and you pointed and you had, if you will, multiple channels.</seg>
<seg id="38">Entebbe happened.</seg>
<seg id="39">1976, Air France was hijacked, taken to Entebbe, and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue, they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport, because they had built the airport,</seg>
<seg id="40">so they built a model in the desert, and when they arrived at Entebbe, they knew where to go because they had actually been there.</seg>
<seg id="41">The U.S. government asked some of us, '76, if we could replicate that computationally,</seg>
<seg id="42">and of course somebody like myself says yes.</seg>
<seg id="43">Immediately, you get a contract, Department of Defense, and we built this truck and this rig.</seg>
<seg id="44">We did sort of a simulation, because you had video discs, and again, this is '76.</seg>
<seg id="45">And then many years later, you get this truck, and so you have Google Maps.</seg>
<seg id="46">Still people thought, no, that was not serious computer science, and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner, who happened to be the president of MIT, who did think it was computer science.</seg>
<seg id="47">And one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life: Make sure your president is part of it.</seg>
<seg id="48">So when I was doing the Media Lab, it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.</seg>
<seg id="49">If you were stopped for speeding and the officer looked in the window and saw who was in the passenger seat, then, "Oh, continue on, sir."</seg>
<seg id="50">And so we were able, and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically. This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner where the only thing that changed in the photograph were the lips.</seg>
<seg id="51">So when you oscillated that little piece of lenticular sheet with his photograph, it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time.</seg>
<seg id="53">So this was the Media Lab's — this is what we said we'd do, that the world of computers, publishing, and so on would come together.</seg>
<seg id="54">Again, not generally accepted, but very much part of TED in the early days.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this is really where we were headed.</seg>
<seg id="56">And that created the Media Lab.</seg>
<seg id="57">One of the things about age is that I can tell you with great confidence, I've been to the future.</seg>
<seg id="58">I've been there, actually, many times.</seg>
<seg id="59">And the reason I say that is, how many times in my life have I said, "Oh, in 10 years, this will happen," and then 10 years comes. And then you say, "Oh, in five years, this will happen." And then five years comes.</seg>
<seg id="60">So I say this a little bit with having felt that I'd been there a number of times,</seg>
<seg id="61">and one of the things that is most quoted that I've ever said is that computing is not about computers,</seg>
<seg id="62">and that didn't quite get enough traction, and then it started to.</seg>
<seg id="63">It started to because people caught on that the medium wasn't the message.</seg>
<seg id="64">And the reason I show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is a student of mine who had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."</seg>
<seg id="66">It was in the early days of GPS, the car knew where it was, and it would give audio instructions to the driver, when to turn right, when to turn left and so on.</seg>
<seg id="67">Turns out, there are a lot of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging, like what does it mean, take the next right?</seg>
<seg id="68">Well, if you're coming up on a street, the next right's probably the one after,</seg>
<seg id="69">and there are lots of issues,</seg>
<seg id="70">and the student did a wonderful thesis, and the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.</seg>
<seg id="71">It'll never be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="72">The liabilities are too large.</seg>
<seg id="73">There will be insurance issues.</seg>
<seg id="74">Don't patent it."</seg>
<seg id="75">So we didn't, but it shows you how people, again, at times, don't really look at what's happening.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some work, and I'll just go through these very quickly, a lot of sensory stuff.</seg>
<seg id="77">You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma and tracking his body for playing the cello or the hypercello.</seg>
<seg id="78">These fellows literally walked around like that at the time.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="80">And then there are at least three heroes I want to quickly mention.</seg>
<seg id="81">Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot about common sense, and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper, who was very important to Ricky Wurman</seg>
<seg id="82">and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage, she said, the first thing she said was, "I introduced Ricky to Nicky."</seg>
<seg id="83">And nobody calls me Nicky and nobody calls Richard Ricky, so nobody knew who she was talking about.</seg>
<seg id="84">And then, of course, Seymour Papert, who is the person who said, "You can't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something."</seg>
<seg id="85">And that's actually — you can unpack that later.</seg>
<seg id="86">It's a pretty profound statement.</seg>
<seg id="87">I'm showing some slides that were from TED 2, a little silly as slides, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="88">Then I felt television really was about displays.</seg>
<seg id="89">Again, now we're past TED 1, but just around the time of TED 2, and what I'd like to mention here is, even though you could imagine intelligence in the device, I look today at some of the work being done about the Internet of Things, and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic, because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone, or the door key onto your cell phone, just taking it and bringing it to you,</seg>
<seg id="90">and in fact that's actually what you don't want.</seg>
<seg id="91">You want to put a chicken in the oven, and the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken," and it cooks the chicken.</seg>
<seg id="92">"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas, and he likes it this way and that way."</seg>
<seg id="93">So the intelligence, instead of being in the device, we have started today to move it back onto the cell phone or closer to the user, not a particularly enlightened view of the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="94">Television, again, television what I said today, that was back in 1990, and the television of tomorrow would look something like that.</seg>
<seg id="95">Again, people, but they laughed cynically, they didn't laugh with much appreciation.</seg>
<seg id="96">Telecommunications in the 1990s, George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram the Negroponte switch.</seg>
<seg id="97">I'm probably much less famous than George, so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck, but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out.</seg>
<seg id="98">That is the original slide from that year, and it has worked in lockstep obedience.</seg>
<seg id="99">We started Wired magazine.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some people, I remember we shared the reception desk periodically, and some parent called up irate that his son had given up Sports Illustrated to subscribe for Wired,</seg>
<seg id="101">and he said, "Are you some porno magazine or something?"</seg>
<seg id="102">and couldn't understand why his son would be interested in Wired, at any rate.</seg>
<seg id="103">I will go through this a little quicker.</seg>
<seg id="104">This is my favorite, 1995,</seg>
<seg id="105">back page of Newsweek magazine. Okay. Read it. ["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure." —Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995] You must admit that gives you, at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are.</seg>
<seg id="106">"Being Digital" came out.</seg>
<seg id="107">For me, it gave me an opportunity to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public,</seg>
<seg id="108">and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,</seg>
<seg id="109">which if you haven't been to, visit, because it's a beautiful piece of architecture aside from being a wonderful place to work.</seg>
<seg id="110">So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs. [Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995] We came to them.</seg>
<seg id="111">I looked forward to it every year.</seg>
<seg id="112">It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had in the sense that he invited many of his old friends, including myself.</seg>
<seg id="113">And then something for me changed pretty profoundly.</seg>
<seg id="114">I became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by Seymour,</seg>
<seg id="115">but particularly looking at learning as something that is best approximated by computer programming.</seg>
<seg id="116">When you write a computer program, you've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions,</seg>
<seg id="117">but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs, you've got to de-bug it.</seg>
<seg id="118">You've got to go in, change it, and then re-execute,</seg>
<seg id="119">and you iterate, and that iteration is really a very, very good approximation of learning.</seg>
<seg id="120">So that led to my own work with Seymour in places like Cambodia and the starting of One Laptop per Child.</seg>
<seg id="121">Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child, so I'll go through it very fast, but it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale in the area of learning, development and computing.</seg>
<seg id="122">Very few people know that One Laptop per Child was a $1 billion project,</seg>
<seg id="123">and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it, but even more important, the World Bank contributed zero, USAID zero.</seg>
<seg id="124">It was mostly the countries using their own treasuries, which is very interesting, at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what I plan to do next.</seg>
<seg id="125">So these are the various places it happened.</seg>
<seg id="126">I then tried an experiment, and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="127">And here's the experiment. The experiment is, can learning happen where there are no schools.</seg>
<seg id="128">And we dropped off tablets with no instructions and let the children figure it out.</seg>
<seg id="129">And in a short period of time, they not only turned them on and were using 50 apps per child within five days, they were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks, but they hacked Android within six months.</seg>
<seg id="130">And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.</seg>
<seg id="131">This is perhaps the best picture I have.</seg>
<seg id="132">The kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher.</seg>
<seg id="133">Look at the kid on the left, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="134">There are no adults involved in this at all.</seg>
<seg id="135">So I said, well can we do this at a larger scale?</seg>
<seg id="136">And what is it that's missing?</seg>
<seg id="137">The kids are giving a press conference at this point, and sort of writing in the dirt.</seg>
<seg id="138">And the answer is, what is missing?</seg>
<seg id="139">And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually, because I'm running out of time,</seg>
<seg id="140">and here's the question, is what's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="141">I think the challenge is to connect the last billion people,</seg>
<seg id="142">and connecting the last billion is very different than connecting the next billion,</seg>
<seg id="143">and the reason it's different is that the next billion are sort of low-hanging fruit,</seg>
<seg id="144">but the last billion are rural.</seg>
<seg id="145">Being rural and being poor are very different.</seg>
<seg id="146">Poverty tends to be created by our society, and the people in that community are not poor in the same way at all.</seg>
<seg id="147">They may be primitive, but the way to approach it and to connect them, the history of One Laptop per Child, and the experiment in Ethiopia, lead me to believe that we can in fact do this in a very short period of time.</seg>
<seg id="148">And so my plan, and unfortunately I haven't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them, but is to do this with a stationary satellite.</seg>
<seg id="149">There are many reasons that stationary satellites aren't the best things, but there are a lot of reasons why they are,</seg>
<seg id="150">and for two billion dollars, you can connect a lot more than 100 million people, but the reason I picked two, and I will leave this as my last slide, is two billion dollars is what we were spending in Afghanistan every week.</seg>
<seg id="151">So surely if we can connect Africa and the last billion people for numbers like that, we should be doing it. Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="152">Stay up there. Stay up there.</seg>
<seg id="153">You're going to give me extra time?</seg>
<seg id="154">No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.</seg>
<seg id="155">You gamed it beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nicholas, what is your prediction?</seg>
<seg id="157">Thank you for asking.</seg>
<seg id="158">I'll tell you what my prediction is,</seg>
<seg id="159">and my prediction, and this is a prediction, because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.</seg>
<seg id="160">But one of the things about learning how to read,</seg>
<seg id="161">we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes, and so that may be a very inefficient channel.</seg>
<seg id="162">So my prediction is that we are going to ingest information</seg>
<seg id="163">You're going to swallow a pill and know English.</seg>
<seg id="164">You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="165">And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.</seg>
<seg id="166">So once it's in your bloodstream, it basically goes through it and gets into the brain, and when it knows that it's in the brain in the different pieces, it deposits it in the right places.</seg>
<seg id="167">So it's ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="168">Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?</seg>
<seg id="169">No, but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here, Hugh Herr,</seg>
<seg id="170">and there are a number of people.</seg>
<seg id="171">This isn't quite as far-fetched, so 30 years from now.</seg>
<seg id="172">We will check it out.</seg>
<seg id="173">We're going to be back and we're going to play this clip 30 years from now, and then all eat the red pill.</seg>
<seg id="174">Well thank you for that.</seg>
<seg id="175">Nicholas Negroponte.</seg>

<title>J.J. Abrams: The mystery box</title>
<description>J.J. Abrams traces his love for the unseen mystery –- a passion that’s evident in his films and TV shows, including Lost, Star Trek and the upcoming Star Wars VII -- back to its magical beginnings.</description>
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/490889">Elena Montrasio</reviewer>

<seg id="1">I wanna start today -- here's my thing. Hold on. There I go.</seg>
<seg id="2">Hey. I wanna start today -- talk about the structure of a polypeptide.</seg>
<seg id="3">I get a lot of people asking me, in terms of "Lost," you know, "What the hell's that island?" You know, it's usually followed by, "No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"</seg>
<seg id="4">Why so many mysteries? What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to?</seg>
<seg id="5">And I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I talked to the kind rep from TED, and I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"</seg>
<seg id="7">He said, "Don't worry about it. Just be profound."</seg>
<seg id="8">And I took enormous comfort in that.</seg>
<seg id="9">So thank you, if you're here.</seg>
<seg id="10">I was trying to think, what do I talk about? It's a good question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery? And I started trying to figure it out.</seg>
<seg id="12">And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do, and I started thinking about my grandfather.</seg>
<seg id="13">I loved my grandfather. Harry Kelvin was his name, my mother's father. He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.</seg>
<seg id="14">And one of the reasons he was amazing: After World War II he began an electronics company.</seg>
<seg id="15">He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.</seg>
<seg id="16">So he had this incredible curiosity. As a kid I saw him come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things.</seg>
<seg id="17">And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them, and reveal the inner workings -- which many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.</seg>
<seg id="19">To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was the ultimate deconstructer, in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="21">And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart, but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts, like, you know, printing, like the letter press. I'm obsessed with printing.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making.</seg>
<seg id="23">When I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff.</seg>
<seg id="24">And last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.</seg>
<seg id="25">I was just looking at it. And I'm telling you ... It's a beautiful thing.</seg>
<seg id="26">I swear to God. I mean, when you look at the box, and you sort of see how it works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair; he does pop-up books.</seg>
<seg id="28">And I'm obsessed with, like, engineering of paper. But like, the scoring of it, the printing of it, where the thing gets glued, you know, the registration marks for the ink. I just love boxes.</seg>
<seg id="29">My grandfather was sort of the guy who, you know, kind of got me into all sorts of these things.</seg>
<seg id="30">He would also supply me with tools.</seg>
<seg id="31">He was this amazing encourager -- this patron, sort of, to make stuff.</seg>
<seg id="32">And he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="33">And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly, to be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.</seg>
<seg id="34">And you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="35">He wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="36">I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like, "Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.</seg>
<seg id="37">You don't understand. This is, like, you know, I want to make movies.</seg>
<seg id="38">I'll get invited to TED one day. This is like -- " And you know, and my grandmother was the greatest.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because she'd be like, you know -- she'd get on the phone. She'd be like, "Harry, it's better than the drugs. He should be doing -- " She was fantastic. So I found myself getting this stuff, thanks to her assist, and suddenly, you know, I had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old -- this kind of stuff.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.</seg>
<seg id="41">He sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.</seg>
<seg id="42">The thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was this great magic store. It was a crappy little building in Midtown, but you'd be in the elevator, the elevator would open -- there'd be this little, small magic store. You'd be in the magic store.</seg>
<seg id="44">And it was just, it was a magical place.</seg>
<seg id="45">So I got all these sort of magic tricks. Oh, here. I'll show you.</seg>
<seg id="46">This is the kind of thing. So it would be like, you know. Right?</seg>
<seg id="47">Which is good, but now I can't move.</seg>
<seg id="48">Now, I have to do this, the rest of the thing, like this.</seg>
<seg id="49">I'm like, "Oh, wow. Look at my computer over there!" Anyway, so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this: Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.</seg>
<seg id="50">The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following: 15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.</seg>
<seg id="51">Which is a savings. Now, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding. If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I've had this forever.</seg>
<seg id="53">Now, I was looking at this, it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf, and I was thinking, why have I not opened this?</seg>
<seg id="54">And why have I kept it? Because I'm not a pack rat. I don't keep everything but for some reason I haven't opened this box.</seg>
<seg id="55">And I felt like there was a key to this, somehow, in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before,</seg>
<seg id="56">So I thought, maybe there's something with this. I started thinking about it.</seg>
<seg id="57">And there was this giant question mark. I love the design, for what it's worth, of this thing. And I started thinking, why haven't I opened it?</seg>
<seg id="58">And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important -- to me. It represents my grandfather.</seg>
<seg id="59">Am I allowed to cry at TED? Because -- no, I'm not going to cry. But -- -- the thing is, that it represents infinite possibility.</seg>
<seg id="60">It represents hope. It represents potential.</seg>
<seg id="61">And what I love about this box, and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do, is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility, that sense of potential.</seg>
<seg id="62">And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.</seg>
<seg id="63">Now, it's not the most ground-breaking idea, but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge, I started getting interested in this.</seg>
<seg id="64">And so I started thinking about "Lost," and the stuff that we do, and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!</seg>
<seg id="65">In how -- in the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I, who created the show with me, we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do. We had 11 and a half weeks to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.</seg>
<seg id="66">So it was not a lot of time. And that sense of possibility -- what could this thing be?</seg>
<seg id="67">There was no time to develop it.</seg>
<seg id="68">I'm sure you're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can't do and what you should change.</seg>
<seg id="69">And there was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.</seg>
<seg id="70">And so we did this show, and for those of you who, you know, who haven't seen it, or don't know it, I can show you this one little clip from the pilot, just to show you some stuff that we did.</seg>
<seg id="71">Help! Please help me! Help me! Help me!</seg>
<seg id="72">Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!</seg>
<seg id="73">I'm having contractions!</seg>
<seg id="74">How many months pregnant are you?</seg>
<seg id="75">I'm only eight months.</seg>
<seg id="76">And how far apart are they coming?</seg>
<seg id="77">I don't know. I think it just happened.</seg>
<seg id="78">Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from -- Now, 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that, we'd have to kill a stuntman.</seg>
<seg id="79">We'd actually -- it would be harder. It would take -- Take 2 would be a bitch.</seg>
<seg id="80">So the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.</seg>
<seg id="81">And part of that was the amazing availability of technology, knowing we could do anything. I mean, we could never have done that.</seg>
<seg id="82">We might have been able to write it; we wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did. And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process, technology is, like, mind-blowingly inspiring to me.</seg>
<seg id="83">I realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?</seg>
<seg id="84">It needs to be filled with something fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="85">I used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I'd flip through.</seg>
<seg id="86">The romance of the script was amazing to me; it would inspire me.</seg>
<seg id="87">I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did.</seg>
<seg id="88">You know, I love Apple computers. I'm obsessed.</seg>
<seg id="89">So the Apple computer -- like those -- the PowerBook -- this computer, right, it challenges me. It basically says, what are you going to write worthy of me? I guess I feel this -- I'm compelled.</seg>
<seg id="90">And I often am like, you know, dude, today I'm out. I got nothing. You know? So there's that. In terms of the content of it, you look at stories, you think, well, what are stories but mystery boxes?</seg>
<seg id="91">There's a fundamental question -- in TV, the first act is called the teaser.</seg>
<seg id="92">It's literally the teaser. It's the big question.</seg>
<seg id="93">So you're drawn into it. Then of course, there's another question. And it goes on and on.</seg>
<seg id="94">Look at "Star Wars." You got the droids; they meet the mysterious woman.</seg>
<seg id="95">Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box! You know?</seg>
<seg id="96">Then you meet Luke Skywalker. He gets the Droid, you see the holographic image.</seg>
<seg id="97">You learn, oh, it's a message, you know.</seg>
<seg id="98">She wants to, you know, find Obi Wan Kenobi. He's her only hope.</seg>
<seg id="99">But who the hell's Obi Wan Kenobi? Mystery box!</seg>
<seg id="100">So then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.</seg>
<seg id="101">Holy shit! You know -- so it keeps us -- -- have you guys not seen that?</seg>
<seg id="102">It's huge! Anyway -- So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.</seg>
<seg id="103">Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information. You know, doing that intentionally is much more engaging.</seg>
<seg id="104">Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" -- if Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked, it would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.</seg>
<seg id="105">In "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!</seg>
<seg id="106">Even in a movie, like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate," they're having that date, remember?</seg>
<seg id="107">And they're in the car, and it's loud, and so they put the top up.</seg>
<seg id="108">They're in there -- you don't hear anything they're saying! You can't hear a word!</seg>
<seg id="109">But it's the most romantic date ever. And you love it because you don't hear it.</seg>
<seg id="110">So to me, there's that.</seg>
<seg id="111">And then, finally, there's this idea -- stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit -- but the idea of the mystery box.</seg>
<seg id="112">Meaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.</seg>
<seg id="113">And it's true in so many movies and stories.</seg>
<seg id="114">And when you look at "E.T.," for example -- "E.T." is this, you know, unbelievable movie about what? It's about an alien who meets a kid, right?</seg>
<seg id="115">Well, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce. "E.T." is about a heartbroken, divorce-crippled family, and ultimately, this kid who can't find his way.</seg>
<seg id="116">"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building.</seg>
<seg id="117">It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.</seg>
<seg id="118">He's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.</seg>
<seg id="119">There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time, but pretty great scenes.</seg>
<seg id="120">There's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you're, you know, expecting.</seg>
<seg id="121">When you look at a movie like "Jaws," the scene that you expect -- we have the screen?</seg>
<seg id="122">These are the kind of, you know, scenes that you remember and expect from "Jaws."</seg>
<seg id="123">And she's being eaten; there's a shark.</seg>
<seg id="124">The thing about "Jaws" is, it's really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world -- with his masculinity, with his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town.</seg>
<seg id="125">This is one of my favorite scenes ever, and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of "Jaws." But it's an amazing scene.</seg>
<seg id="126">C'mere. Give us a kiss.</seg>
<seg id="127">Why?</seg>
<seg id="128">'Cause I need it.</seg>
<seg id="129">C'mon. "Why? 'Cause I need it?" Best scene ever, right?</seg>
<seg id="130">Come on! So you think of "Jaws" -- so that's the kind of stuff that, like, you know, the investment of character, which is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?</seg>
<seg id="131">It's why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre, they're ripping off the wrong thing.</seg>
<seg id="132">You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.</seg>
<seg id="133">You gotta rip off -- you know, if you rip something off -- rip off the character.</seg>
<seg id="134">Rip off the stuff that matters. I mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.</seg>
<seg id="135">Because ultimately, you know, the mystery box is all of us. So there's that.</seg>
<seg id="136">Then the distribution. What's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater?</seg>
<seg id="137">You know? You go to the theater, you're just so excited to see anything.</seg>
<seg id="138">The moment the lights go down is often the best part, you know?</seg>
<seg id="139">And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation.</seg>
<seg id="140">And often, the movie's, like, there and it's going, and then something happens and you go, "Oh--" and then something else, and you're, "Mmm ..."</seg>
<seg id="141">Now, when it's a great movie, you're along for the ride 'cause you're willing to give yourself to it.</seg>
<seg id="142">So to me, whether it's that, whether it's a TV, an iPod, computer, cell phone --</seg>
<seg id="143">it's funny, I'm an -- as I said, Apple fanatic -- and one day, about a year or so ago, I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote, 'cause I always do. And he came on, he was presenting the video iPod, and what was on the enormous iPod behind him?</seg>
<seg id="144">"Lost"! I had no idea! And I realized, holy shit, it'd come full circle.</seg>
<seg id="145">Like, the inspiration I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do, inspired by it, to sell technology. I mean, it's nuts! I was gonna show you a couple of other things I'm gonna skip through.</seg>
<seg id="146">I just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything.</seg>
<seg id="147">This is something online; I don't know if you've seen it before.</seg>
<seg id="148">Six years ago they did this. This is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience. But the point was, that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had -- everyone has now.</seg>
<seg id="149">What I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid, everyone has access to now.</seg>
<seg id="150">You don't need to have my grandfather, though you wished you had.</seg>
<seg id="151">But I have to tell you -- this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer -- the resolution's a little bit low -- using Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="152">He's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I've seen released from Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="153">The most incredible sort of mystery, I think, is now the question of what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="154">Because it is now democratized. So now, the creation of media is -- it's everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="155">The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="156">And so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.</seg>
<seg id="157">And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced, you know -- who have been silenced in the past -- it's a very exciting thing.</seg>
<seg id="158">I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff, to someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing." It's free, you know, you don't need permission to go write. But now I can say, "Go make your movie!" There's nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology.</seg>
<seg id="159">You can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelf that is either as good, or just as good, as the stuff that's being used by the, you know, quote unquote "legit people."</seg>
<seg id="160">No community is best served when only the elite have control.</seg>
<seg id="161">And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there.</seg>
<seg id="162">When I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects stuff.</seg>
<seg id="163">ILM did the effects; it was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="164">And sort of like my dream to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="165">And there are a couple of sequences in the movie, like these couple of moments I'll show you.</seg>
<seg id="166">There's that.</seg>
<seg id="167">Okay, obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.</seg>
<seg id="168">So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.</seg>
<seg id="169">And it's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up. He's drowsy. He's crazy</seg>
<seg id="170">And the guy wakes up, and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he's going to use later to kill him, as bad guys do.</seg>
<seg id="171">Good morning.</seg>
<seg id="172">OK, now. When we shot that scene, we were there doing it, the actor who had the gun, an English actor, Eddie Marsan -- sweetheart, great guy -- he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose, and it was hurting Tom's nose.</seg>
<seg id="173">And I learned this very early on in my career: Don't hurt Tom's nose. There are three things you don't want to do. Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.</seg>
<seg id="174">So Eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet English guy. He's like, "Sorry, I don't want to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="175">I'm like -- you gotta -- we have to make this look good.</seg>
<seg id="176">And I realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was.</seg>
<seg id="177">And I literally, like, thought back to what I would have done using the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room, and I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's. It could be Tom's.</seg>
<seg id="178">And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun. He wouldn't hurt himself.</seg>
<seg id="179">So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.</seg>
<seg id="180">We put it in Eddie's sleeve, and so the hand that you see -- I'll show you again, that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.</seg>
<seg id="181">So Tom is playing two roles. And he didn't ask for any more money.</seg>
<seg id="182">So here, here. Watch it again.</seg>
<seg id="183">There he is. He's waking up. He's drowsy, been through a lot.</seg>
<seg id="184">Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Anyway.</seg>
<seg id="185">So.</seg>
<seg id="186">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="187">So you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies.</seg>
<seg id="188">And the mystery box, in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.</seg>
<seg id="189">Thank you.</seg>

<title>Hubertus Knabe: The dark secrets of a surveillance state</title>
<description>Tour the deep dark world of the East German state security agency known as Stasi. Uniquely powerful at spying on its citizens, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the Stasi masterminded a system of surveillance and psychological pressure that kept the country under control for decades. Hubertus Knabe studies the Stasi — and was spied on by them. He shares stunning details from the fall of a surveillance state, and shows how easy it was for neighbor to turn on neighbor.</description>
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer>
<translator></translator>
<seg id="1">This year, Germany is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution in East Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away, the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later, the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, in the East was unified with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West to found today's Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among many other things, Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only two years after its dissolution, its documents were opened to the public, and historians such as me started to study these documents to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state functioned.</seg>
<seg id="5">Perhaps you have watched the movie "The Lives of Others."</seg>
<seg id="6">This movie made the Stasi known worldwide, and as we live in an age where words such as "surveillance" or "wiretapping" are on the front pages of newspapers, I would like to speak about how the Stasi really worked.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning, let's have a short look at the history of the Stasi, because it's really important for understanding its self-conception.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its origins are located in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 1917, the Russian Communists founded the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, shortly Cheka.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies.</seg>
<seg id="12">It evolved later into the well-known KGB.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.</seg>
<seg id="14">They called themselves Chekists, and even the emblem was very similar, as you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the secret police of Russia was the creator and instructor of the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945, it immediately expanded there, and soon it started to train the German Communists to build up their own secret police.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the way, in this hall where we are now, the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="18">Five years later, the Stasi was established, and step by step, the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">For instance, the central jail for political prisoners, which was established by the Russians, was taken over by the Stasi and used until the end of Communism.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the beginning, every important step took place under the attendance of the Russians.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the Germans are known to be very effective, so the Stasi grew very quickly, and already in 1953, it had more employees than the Gestapo had, the secret police of Nazi Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number doubled in each decade.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1989, more than 90,000 employees worked for the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="25">This meant that one employee was responsible for 180 inhabitants, which was really unique in the world.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the top of this tremendous apparatus, there was one man, Erich Mielke.</seg>
<seg id="27">He ruled the Ministry of State Security for more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was a scrupulous functionary — in his past, he killed two policemen not far away from here — who in fact personalized the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="29">But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?</seg>
<seg id="30">Foremost, it was its enormous power, because it united different functions in one organization.</seg>
<seg id="31">First of all, the Stasi was an intelligence service.</seg>
<seg id="32">It used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly, such as informers, or tapping phones, as you can see it on the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="33">And it was not only active in East Germany, but all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="34">Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.</seg>
<seg id="35">It could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thirdly, the Stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="37">It had the right to open preliminary investigations and to interrogate people officially.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last but not least, the Stasi had its own armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="39">More than 11,000 soldiers were serving in its so-called Guards Regiment.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.</seg>
<seg id="41">Due to this concentration of power, the Stasi was called a state in the state.</seg>
<seg id="42">But let's look in more and more detail at the tools of the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="43">Please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course, the Stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people.</seg>
<seg id="45">Telephones were wiretapped, including the phone of the German chancellor in the West, and often also the apartments.</seg>
<seg id="46">Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened by these machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took.</seg>
<seg id="48">In this picture, you can see me as a young man just in front of this building where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Stasi even collected the smell of people.</seg>
<seg id="50">It stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution.</seg>
<seg id="51">For all these tasks, highly specialized departments were responsible.</seg>
<seg id="52">The one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters, for good reasons, because if one agent quit the Stasi, his knowledge was very small.</seg>
<seg id="53">Contrast that with Snowden, for example.</seg>
<seg id="54">But the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation.</seg>
<seg id="55">The agent who shadowed me didn't know who I was or why I was surveyed.</seg>
<seg id="56">In fact, I smuggled forbidden books from West to East Germany.</seg>
<seg id="57">But what was even more typical for the Stasi was the use of human intelligence, people who reported secretly to the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="58">For the Minister of State Security, these so-called unofficial employees were the most important tools.</seg>
<seg id="59">From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people collaborated constantly with the Stasi, more than one percent of the population.</seg>
<seg id="60">And in a way, the minister was right, because technical instruments can only register what people are doing, but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking.</seg>
<seg id="61">Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.</seg>
<seg id="62">The system of how to get them and how to educate them, as it was called, was very sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Stasi had its own university, not far away from here, where the methods were explored and taught to the officers.</seg>
<seg id="64">This guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured to becoming one, but that's mostly not true, because a forced informant is a bad informant.</seg>
<seg id="66">Only someone who wants to give you the information you need is an effective whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="67">The main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi were political conviction and material benefits.</seg>
<seg id="68">The officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant, and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows that it's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others.</seg>
<seg id="69">Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany collaborated with the Stasi, as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.</seg>
<seg id="70">In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR until it came out that he was an informant.</seg>
<seg id="71">The net of spies was really broad.</seg>
<seg id="72">In nearly every institution, even in the churches or in West Germany, there were many of them.</seg>
<seg id="73">I remember telling a leading Stasi officer, "If you had sent an informant to me, I would surely have recognized him." His answer was, "We didn't send anyone.</seg>
<seg id="74">We took those who were around you." And in fact, two of my best friends reported about me to the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="75">Not only in my case, informers were very close.</seg>
<seg id="76">For example, Vera Lengsfeld, another leading dissident, in her case it was her husband who spied on her.</seg>
<seg id="77">A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.</seg>
<seg id="78">This reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell, where the only apparently trustable person was an informer.</seg>
<seg id="79">But why did the Stasi collect all this information in its archives?</seg>
<seg id="80">The main purpose was to control the society.</seg>
<seg id="81">In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who, which meant who thinks what.</seg>
<seg id="82">He didn't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime.</seg>
<seg id="83">He wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning.</seg>
<seg id="84">The East Germans knew, of course, that they were surrounded by informers, in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear, the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="85">That's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime.</seg>
<seg id="86">If yes, the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was called Zersetzung, and it's described in another guideline.</seg>
<seg id="88">The word is difficult to translate because it means originally "biodegradation."</seg>
<seg id="89">But actually, it's a quite accurate description.</seg>
<seg id="90">The goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people, for example by damaging their reputation, by organizing failures in their work, and by destroying their personal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="91">Considering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="92">The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.</seg>
<seg id="93">It preferred to paralyze them, and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions.</seg>
<seg id="94">Detaining someone was used only as a last resort.</seg>
<seg id="95">For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons, one in every district.</seg>
<seg id="96">Here, the Stasi also developed quite modern methods of detention.</seg>
<seg id="97">Normally, the interrogation officer didn't torture the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="98">Instead, he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central.</seg>
<seg id="99">Nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony.</seg>
<seg id="100">If you have the occasion, do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked.</seg>
<seg id="101">One more question needs to be answered: If the Stasi were so well organized, why did the Communist regime collapse?</seg>
<seg id="102">First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany was uncertain what to do against the growing protest of people.</seg>
<seg id="103">It was especially confused because in the mother country of socialism, the Soviet Union, a more liberal policy took place.</seg>
<seg id="104">In addition, the regime was dependent on the loans from the West.</seg>
<seg id="105">Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising was given to the Stasi.</seg>
<seg id="106">Secondly, in the Communist ideology, there's no place for criticism.</seg>
<seg id="107">Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief that socialism is a perfect system, and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.</seg>
<seg id="108">The consequence was that despite all the information, the regime couldn't analyze its real problems, and therefore it couldn't solve them.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the end, the Stasi died because of the structures that it was charged with protecting.</seg>
<seg id="110">The ending of the Stasi was something tragic, because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing: to destroy the documents they had produced during decades.</seg>
<seg id="111">Fortunately, they had been stopped by human rights activists.</seg>
<seg id="112">That's why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions.</seg>
<seg id="113">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="114">Thank you. Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="115">So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.</seg>
<seg id="116">"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="117">And you just told us about my neighbor, the spies and the informant from East Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">So there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn't?</seg>
<seg id="119">What's your reaction as a historian when you see this?</seg>
<seg id="120">I think there are several aspects to mention.</seg>
<seg id="121">At first, I think there's a difference of why you are collecting this data.</seg>
<seg id="122">Are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks, or are you doing that for oppressing your people?</seg>
<seg id="123">So that makes a fundamental difference.</seg>
<seg id="124">But on the other hand, also in a democracy, these instruments can be abused, and that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that, and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have.</seg>
<seg id="125">The third point, probably, we really can be happy that we live in a democracy, because you can be sure that Russia and China are doing the same, but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that.</seg>
<seg id="126">When the story came out first, last July, last year, you filed a criminal complaint with a German tribunal. Why?</seg>
<seg id="127">Yeah, I did so because of the second point I mentioned, that I think especially in a democracy, the rules are for everybody.</seg>
<seg id="128">They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed that any institution doesn't respect the rules.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the criminal code of Germany, it's written that it's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the judge.</seg>
<seg id="130">Fortunately, it's written in the criminal code of Germany, so if it's not respected, then I think an investigation is necessary, and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of Germany started this, and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel, and not in the case of all the other people living in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="131">That doesn't surprise me because — — because of the story you told.</seg>
<seg id="132">Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany, and I expected the Germans to react much more strongly, immediately.</seg>
<seg id="133">And instead, the reaction really came only when Chancellor Merkel was revealed as being wiretapped. Why so?</seg>
<seg id="134">I take it as a good sign, because people feel secure in this democracy.</seg>
<seg id="135">They aren't afraid that they will be arrested, and if you leave this hall after the conference, nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you.</seg>
<seg id="136">So that's a good sign, I think.</seg>
<seg id="137">People are not really scared.</seg>
<seg id="138">But of course, I think, the institutions are responsible to stop illegal actions in Germany or wherever they happen.</seg>
<seg id="139">A personal question, and this is the last one.</seg>
<seg id="140">There has been a debate in Germany about granting asylum to Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="141">Would you be in favor or against?</seg>
<seg id="142">Oh, that's a difficult question, but if you ask me, and if I answer honestly, I would give him the asylum, because I think it was really brave what he did, and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything.</seg>
<seg id="143">So I think, for these people, we should do something, and especially if you see the German history, where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn't get it, so it would be a good sign to give him asylum.</seg>
<seg id="144">Hubertus, thank you very much.</seg>
