<seg id="1">Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on vault.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jaw-dropping on floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all over.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.</seg>
<seg id="21">While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.</seg>
<seg id="28">She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.</seg>
<seg id="32">She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:</seg>
