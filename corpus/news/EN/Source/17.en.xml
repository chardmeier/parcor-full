<seg id="1">Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world turns.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">So how does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes somebody might walk into a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">So what?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.</seg>
<seg id="30">However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>
