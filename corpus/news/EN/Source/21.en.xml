<seg id="1">Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It came up to my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.</seg>
<seg id="24">Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="27">CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.</seg>
<seg id="29">Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.</seg>
<seg id="30">Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.</seg>
<seg id="34">This one is on track to be a similar event.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."</seg>
