<seg id="1">Comparing Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's economic policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He would do things totally differently, Trump says.</seg>
<seg id="9">He would repeal regulations, and lead a wide-reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Conversely, Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil, giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="11">This would increase taxes for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, they have similar views on infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">There has to be investment in infrastructure, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat policies, and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican party, which is critical of the state.</seg>
<seg id="16">Consequently, Trump could lead to discussions within the party.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will become the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will either be China, Germany or America - and I want it to be us."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">Neither want to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then also be better paid, Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance, she says.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this score: Once he said that the minimum wage had to be raised, then he said it should stay the same.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties' tax policies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trump is on one side, wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics state that this will just increase the budgetary deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clinton is on the opposite side: as a minimum, she wants the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>
