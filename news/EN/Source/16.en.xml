<seg id="1">Who is going to build Braunschweig's low-cost housing?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low-cost homes over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">At the next council meeting, the SPD is going to put forward an "action plan for homes".</seg>
<seg id="5">But it won't be smooth sailing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Firstly, there is the question of who is actually going to build the low-cost homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, no settlement has been reached on this point.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD group chairman, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on municipal land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The low-cost homes could also be older homes that are renovated.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to build on private ground?"</seg>
<seg id="11">We want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent, but if possible, 20 percent, of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will cost millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment, there is no agreement between groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to put as few rules on investors as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite that, according to Bratman, the situation in terms of the housing market is also hotting up.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, the building authorities will be faced with additional tasks.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear if we will get the specialist staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not quite complete: because the approximately 1260 new homes are to be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">This will come to 500 homes even by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, spokeswoman for planning policy, bonds that are about to mature should be purchased by the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scenario.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west of the city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is because deadlines expire at the end of the year in the west of the city.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 homes could then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step back from the target of "blending".</seg>
<seg id="31">No longer are socially disadvantaged people to be concentrated in a small number of districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group chairman Holger Herlitschke thinks that "the CDU will have to get into bed with us to reach a decent majority."</seg>
<seg id="34">However, they have focused on providing more building sites for detached homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise.</seg>
