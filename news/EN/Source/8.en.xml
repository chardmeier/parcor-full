<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland</seg>
<seg id="2">The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.</seg>
